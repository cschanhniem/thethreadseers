## ⚠️ Current Issue

The only remaining issue is with the **dependency installation process**, which seems to be hanging in your environment. This is likely due to network or npm configuration issues, not the code itself.

## 🔧 Next Steps to Complete

1. **Resolve Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test and Refine**:
   - Verify all pages load correctly
   - Test mobile responsiveness
   - Check accessibility features
   - Add any additional content
