## Philosophical Foundation

The Thread Seers series is built on a foundation of interconnectedness, drawing inspiration from Buddhist concepts of dependent origination (the twelve nidanas). This philosophical framework is integrated throughout the character development, magic system, and overall narrative structure.

The twelve nidanas provide a lens through which characters understand their abilities and relationships, creating a cohesive thematic throughline that unifies the diverse cultural approaches to thread magic.
