# Book 3: Age of Messiahs - Historical Integration Plan

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for integrating the historical thread developments of the Age of Messiahs (1 CE - 700 CE) into the narrative framework of "The Thread Seers" series. Each historical event or development is linked to specific narrative consequences, character opportunities, and potential plot elements, ensuring that the rich historical tapestry of this period enhances rather than overwhelms the storytelling.
