# Colonization Thread Appropriation

## Introduction

The Age of Exploration and subsequent colonial expansion (15th-19th centuries) represented one of the most profound disruptions in global thread traditions since the dawn of human thread manipulation. As European powers established colonies across the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Oceania, they encountered diverse indigenous thread practices that had developed independently for millennia. The resulting interactions between European and indigenous thread traditions were characterized by complex dynamics of appropriation, suppression, resistance, and synthesis.

This period saw the systematic extraction of indigenous thread knowledge, often without recognition or compensation; the establishment of colonial thread institutions that privileged European approaches; and the development of resistance strategies by indigenous thread practitioners seeking to preserve their traditions. The thread dimension itself was profoundly altered by these colonial encounters, with lasting consequences that continue to shape global thread practices today.

This document explores the mechanisms of colonial thread appropriation, the institutional structures that facilitated it, the resistance strategies developed by indigenous practitioners, and the ethical implications of this historical process for contemporary thread practice.

## European Extraction of Indigenous Thread Knowledge

### Mechanisms of Thread Knowledge Acquisition

European colonial powers developed systematic approaches to acquiring indigenous thread knowledge:

**Scientific Expeditions**
- **Core Approach**: Scholarly missions ostensibly for scientific documentation
