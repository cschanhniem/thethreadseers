# Book 6: Age of Machines - Historical Integration Plan

## Overview

This integration plan connects the historical thread developments of the Age of Machines (1850-1945) to the narrative elements of Book 6 in "The Thread Seers" series. The period represents a pivotal transformation in humanity's relationship with the thread dimension, as industrialization, global warfare, and esoteric revivals created unprecedented thread phenomena and new paradigms for thread understanding. This plan provides a structured approach for incorporating these historical elements into character backgrounds, plot developments, settings, and thematic explorations.
