# Thread Philosophy

## Overview
This directory contains documentation of the philosophical frameworks and approaches to thread magic in The Thread Seers universe. These philosophical perspectives shape how characters understand, interact with, and make ethical decisions about thread manipulation.

## Directory Structure

### [Thread Philosophy Framework](thread_philosophy_framework.md)
The foundational document outlining the major philosophical approaches to thread magic and the ethical questions they address.

### Approaches
Detailed exploration of the major philosophical perspectives on thread interaction.

- **[Preservationist](approaches/preservationist.md)**: Focused on maintaining thread stability and minimal intervention
- **[Interventionist](approaches/interventionist.md)**: Advocates for active thread manipulation to achieve positive outcomes
- **[Symbiotic](approaches/symbiotic.md)**: Emphasizes communication and cooperation with thread dimension consciousness
- **[Traditional](approaches/traditional.md)**: Honors culturally embedded practices and ancestral wisdom

### Nidanas
Integration of Buddhist concepts into thread philosophy.

- **[Twelve Nidanas Integration](nidanas/twelve_nidanas_integration.md)**: How the Buddhist concept of dependent origination informs thread understanding
