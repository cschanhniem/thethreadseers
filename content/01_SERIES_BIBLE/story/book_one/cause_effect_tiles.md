# The Thread Seers: 15 Cause-&-Effect Tiles

## Overview
This document breaks down "The Thread Seers" into 15 essential cause-and-effect tiles that form the narrative spine of the novel. Each tile directly causes the next, creating a clear chain of causality from the inciting incident in Saigon 1943 to Lyra's Convergence sacrifice.

## Application to Revision

When evaluating each chapter, ask:
1. Which tile(s) does this chapter advance?
2. Does this chapter directly cause events in the next tile?
3. If not, can it be condensed or cut?

Chapters that don't contribute to this causal chain create "narrative drag" and should be prime targets for revision or removal.
