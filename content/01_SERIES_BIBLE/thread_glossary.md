# The Thread Seers: Glossary of Key Terms

## Thread Types & Phenomena

**Animus Argenti** (Latin: "Soul of Silver") - A rare, powerful thread type that serves as the thread dimension's immune response and communication medium. Manifests as silver-white energy that can interact with all other thread types. Associated with the Chen family lineage.

**黑银丝** (hēi yín sī) - "Black-silver threads." Corrupted thread energy associated with the Umbra Protocol and thread harvesting. Appears as black threads with silver edges that consume rather than connect.

**金缘丝** (jīn yuán sī) - "Golden affinity threads." Chinese tradition term for threads that connect people to objects of personal significance or long association.

**记忆丝** (jì yì sī) - "Memory threads." Threads that connect people to significant memories or past experiences. Often appear as golden-amber in color.

**习惯丝** (xí guàn sī) - "Habit threads." Threads formed through repeated actions or routines. Typically appear as bronze or copper-colored.

**情感丝** (qíng gǎn sī) - "Emotional threads." Threads that connect people who share strong emotional bonds. Color varies based on the nature of the relationship.

**Thread-Quake** - Physical manifestation of thread dimension instability, causing tremors in the physical world. Measured on a percentage scale of dimensional instability.

**Thread Collapse** - Catastrophic failure of a thread nexus point, resulting in severed connections and memory loss for those affected. The Kyoto Collapse is the most significant recent example.

**Thread Harvesting** - Unethical practice of extracting thread energy from living beings or nexus points for use in devices or personal power enhancement.

**Thread Burn** - Physical condition resulting from improper thread manipulation or dimensional crossing, manifesting as silver scarring along nerve pathways.

**Thread Blindness** - Condition where a thread seer loses the ability to visually perceive threads but may develop alternative perception methods.

**The Weave** - The collective network of all threads in a given area. The Global Weave refers to the worldwide thread network connecting all major nexus points.

**Weave-Quake Counter** - Device that measures thread dimension stability on a percentage scale. Safe threshold is below 5%.

## Cultural Thread Traditions

### Chinese Tradition

**丝视者** (sī shì zhě) - "Thread Seer." One who can naturally perceive the thread dimension.

**丝网的疤痕** (sīwǎng de bāhén) - "Silk net scars." Term for damaged areas in the Weave.

**气通丝线** (qì tōng sīxiàn) - "Breath threading through silk." Breathing technique used to enhance thread perception and manipulation.

**针灸修复** (zhēnjiǔ xiūfù) - "Acupuncture repair." Ancient Chinese technique for healing damaged thread patterns.

**银针引路** (yín zhēn yǐn lù) - "Silver needle pathfinding." Technique using silver needles to guide thread energy through damaged pathways.

**心眼** (xīn yǎn) - "Mind's eye." Advanced perception technique used by thread masters who have transcended visual thread perception.

### West African Tradition

**ìtàn àwọn okùn** (Yoruba) - "Story-thread." Technique of weaving verbal narratives to strengthen personal thread connections and history.

### Korean Tradition

**실 치유** (sil chiyu) - "Thread healing." Korean technique for stabilizing damaged thread patterns.

**기운 회복** (gi-un hoebog) - "Energy restoration." Acupressure technique that uses thread-infused pressure points to restore depleted thread energy.

### Egyptian Tradition

**Ka-Weaving** - Egyptian tradition of thread manipulation focusing on life force (ka) and its connections to both the living and ancestral realms.

## Organizations & Locations

**Threadweaver Academy** - Premier global institution for thread education, founded on principles of multicultural thread tradition integration.

**The Council** - Governing body of twelve Elders representing different thread traditions, plus the Headmistress of Threadweaver Academy.

**Nexus Syndicate** - Shadow organization that exploits thread energy for profit and power, rejecting traditional ethics of thread manipulation.

**Thread Nexus** - Location where multiple thread lines converge, creating a powerful concentration of thread energy. Major nexus points exist globally.

**The Magnus Conduit** - Harlow's machine designed to harvest and redistribute thread energy on a global scale.

**The Resonance Chamber** - Specialized room at Threadweaver Academy designed to amplify and clarify thread vibrations for auditory perception.

**The Meditation Chamber** - Ancient circular room in the Academy's oldest tower, designed to enhance thread perception through multicultural design elements.

**The Observatory Tower** - Highest point at Threadweaver Academy, containing instruments that measure the global thread dimension.

**The Harmonic Resonator** - Ancient device in the Observatory Tower that maps and connects to thread nexus points across the globe.

## Historical Events

**The Kyoto Collapse (1997)** - Catastrophic thread nexus failure that resulted in severed connections and memory loss for those affected. Reached 63% instability.

**The Third Nexus War** - Historical conflict over thread resources that reached 87% global instability and resulted in the loss of the Singapore Threadhold.

**The Umbra Protocol (1943)** - Experimental program that attempted to weaponize thread energy, resulting in "accelerated entropic decay of localized Weave integrity."

**The Convergence** - Prophesied event involving a fundamental shift in the thread dimension, nature unknown.

## Thread Abilities & Techniques

**Thread Sight** - Ability to visually perceive the thread dimension and its connections.

**Thread Resonance** - Ability to hear thread vibrations as musical tones and harmonies (Milo's specialty).

**Thread Empathy** - Ability to sense and influence emotional threads between people (Zara's specialty).

**Thread Analysis** - Ability to perceive and decode complex thread patterns and systems (Eli's specialty).

**Thread Artistry** - Ability to create and manipulate visual thread patterns (Lyra's specialty).

**Multi-Spectrum Manipulation** - Advanced technique of simultaneously manipulating multiple thread types.

**Thread Communion** - Philosophy of working with the thread dimension as a conscious entity rather than controlling it.

**Thread Control** - Philosophy of imposing order on the thread dimension through scientific principles and technology.

**Seventh Seal Protocol** - High-level Council protection measure implemented for individuals at extreme risk.

## Key Artifacts
