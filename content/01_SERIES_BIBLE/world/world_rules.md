# World Rules: The Thread System

## The Nature of Threads

### Physical Properties
- **Visibility**: Invisible to most people but perceived by Thread Seers through different senses
- **Composition**: Living energy that manifests with distinct color, thickness, texture, luminosity, sound, and emotional resonance
- **Connection Range**: Link people, places, objects, concepts, memories, and potential futures
- **Dimensional Nature**: Exist in a dimension that overlays our own but is typically unseen
- **Conservation Principle**: Cannot be created or destroyed completely, only redirected, strengthened, or weakened
- **Adaptive Response**: Threads respond to interaction, developing complexity when frequently manipulated

### Thread Types by Connection
1. **Relationship Threads** (most common)
   - **Family Bonds** (Red): Deep crimson for parents/children, lighter shades for extended family
   - **Friendship** (Gold): Bright gold for close friends, pale yellow for acquaintances
   - **Romantic Connections** (Purple): Lavender for attraction, deep violet for lasting love
   - **Mentorship** (Blue): Royal blue for teacher/student, teal for peer mentoring
   - **Community** (Green): Forest green for strong communities, mint for casual groups
   - **Strained Relationships** (Gray): Charcoal for serious conflict, silver-gray for healing connections
   - **Harmful Connections** (Black): Jet black with red edges for abusive relationships

2. **Temporal Threads** (uncommon)
   - **Memory Threads** (Copper): Connect people to their past experiences
   - **Destiny Threads** (Silver): Link to potential futures, with multiple strands for different possibilities
   - **Ancient Threads** (Bronze): Historical connections that have existed for generations
   - **Moment Threads** (White-Gold): Fleeting connections formed during significant shared experiences

3. **Essence Threads** (rare)
   - **Talent Threads** (Emerald): Connect people to their innate abilities and potential
   - **Identity Threads** (Indigo): Core threads that define a person's true self
   - **Passion Threads** (Orange): Link people to what they love and what motivates them
   - **Purpose Threads** (White): Connect people to their life's calling or mission

### Thread Perception Types
Different Thread Seers perceive threads through different senses, creating a synesthetic magic system:

1. **Visualizers** (most common)
   - See threads as colored strands of light
   - Perceive texture, thickness, and luminosity
   - Can distinguish subtle color variations and patterns
   - Lyra is a rare multi-spectrum Visualizer who sees all thread types with unusual clarity

2. **Resonators** (uncommon)
   - Hear threads as musical tones or harmonies
   - Different relationships create different notes and chords
   - Dissonance indicates conflict or strain
   - Can "play" threads to affect their nature

3. **Empaths** (uncommon)
   - Feel the emotional quality and intensity of connections
   - Experience physical sensations corresponding to thread types
   - Particularly sensitive to harmful or healing threads
   - Can sense emotional changes before they manifest visibly

4. **Navigators** (rare)
   - Sense directional pull and distance of connections
   - Perceive thread networks as mental maps
   - Can trace connections across great distances
   - Naturally gifted at finding lost people or objects

## The Living Network (Revealed Gradually)

### Thread Intelligence
- Threads collectively form a vast, evolving network with emergent properties
- The network is gradually developing consciousness across the series
- "Darkening" threads represent increased complexity, not damage
- Thread Seers function as "neurons" in this developing consciousness
- The network learns from how Thread Seers interact with and manipulate threads

### Network Evolution Stages
1. **Dormant** (Pre-series): Threads function as passive connections
2. **Awakening** (Books 1-3): Network begins responding to deliberate manipulation
3. **Communicating** (Books 4-5): Network attempts to communicate with sensitive Thread Seers
4. **Emerging Consciousness** (Books 6-7): Network develops true awareness and purpose

## Limitations and Rules

### Natural Laws
1. **Conservation of Connection**: Threads cannot be created or destroyed, only redirected, strengthened, or weakened
2. **Resonance**: Similar threads vibrate at similar frequencies and can affect each other
3. **Resistance**: People naturally resist having their threads manipulated without consent
4. **Visibility Threshold**: Stronger emotions and connections create more perceptible threads
5. **Thread Memory**: Threads retain impressions of how they've been manipulated
6. **Effort Correlation**: The difficulty of manipulation scales with the significance of the connection
7. **Dimensional Anchoring**: Threads connect to the physical world at points of emotional significance

### The Threadweaver's Code
1. **Core Ethical Principles**:
   - Respect for Autonomy: Never manipulate threads without consent (except in emergencies)
   - Non-Maleficence: Avoid severing connection threads completely
   - Truth in Connection: Never create false connections to manipulate others
   - Selfless Service: Do not use thread abilities primarily for personal gain

2. **Consequences of Violations**:
   - Thread-blindness: Temporary or permanent loss of the Sight
   - Thread-sickness: Physical symptoms including migraines, nausea, and fatigue
   - Emotional feedback: Experiencing the negative emotions caused by manipulation
   - Thread-lost state: Losing one's own connections, becoming emotionally isolated

## Thread Manipulation Effects and Consequences

### Intended Effects
- **Strengthening**: Enhancing positive connections improves relationships and emotional wellbeing
- **Healing**: Repairing damaged threads restores healthy relationship dynamics
- **Reading**: Perceiving thread history provides insight into relationship patterns
- **Weaving**: Creating new pathways between existing threads opens new possibilities
- **Shielding**: Protecting vulnerable threads from external manipulation or damage
- **Seeking**: Following threads to find connected people, objects, or memories

### Side Effects and Costs
- **Energy Depletion**: Manipulation requires personal energy proportional to the effect
- **Thread Strain**: Overexertion causes headaches, fatigue, and temporary ability reduction
- **Emotional Bleedthrough**: Manipulators may experience emotions from the threads they touch
- **Snapback Effect**: Threads forcibly changed will try to return to their natural state
- **Self-Manipulation Difficulty**: Altering one's own threads requires extraordinary effort and carries greater risks
- **Perception Overload**: Seeing too many threads simultaneously can cause sensory overwhelm

### Thread Phenomena
- **Thread Tangles**: Chaotic knots of threads that trap and confuse Thread Seers
- **Thread Storms**: Violent disturbances where threads whip and lash unpredictably
- **Thread Parasites**: Entities that feed on thread energy, appearing as shadow-like forms
- **Thread Voids**: Areas where connections are temporarily suppressed, creating emotional dead zones
- **Thread Nexuses**: Places where many threads converge, amplifying thread abilities
- **Thread Echoes**: Impressions left in the thread dimension from powerful past events
- **Thread Bloom**: Rare phenomenon where threads briefly become visible to everyone
- **Thread Resonance Cascade**: Chain reaction of thread effects spreading beyond the initial manipulation
