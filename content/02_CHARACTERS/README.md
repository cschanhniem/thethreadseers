## Philosophical Integration

Each character has been enhanced with philosophical depth through the integration of the twelve nidanas (links of dependent origination) from Buddhist philosophy. This adds layers of meaning to their abilities, motivations, and character arcs.

### The Twelve Nidanas

1. **Ignorance (Avidyā)** - Fundamental misunderstanding of reality
2. **Formations (Saṃskāra)** - Mental formations/karma created through ignorance
3. **Consciousness (Vijñāna)** - Awareness conditioned by formations
4. **Name and Form (Nāmarūpa)** - Mental and physical phenomena
5. **Six Sense Bases (Ṣaḍāyatana)** - The six senses (including mind)
6. **Contact (Sparśa)** - Encounter between sense organs and objects
7. **Feeling (Vedanā)** - Pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral sensations
8. **Craving (Tṛṣṇā)** - Desire arising from feeling
9. **Clinging (Upādāna)** - Attachment to objects of desire
10. **Becoming (Bhava)** - Process of coming into existence
11. **Birth (Jāti)** - Beginning of a new life/identity
12. **Aging and Death (Jarāmaraṇa)** - Decay and end of life/identity

Each character embodies specific nidanas that connect to their thread abilities, personal challenges, and growth arcs, creating a philosophically rich tapestry that explores the nature of reality, connection, and transformation.
