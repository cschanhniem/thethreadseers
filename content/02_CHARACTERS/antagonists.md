# Antagonists

The antagonist characters have been reorganized into a modular directory structure for better organization and easier updates. Please refer to the new structure in the `antagonists` directory.

## Directory Structure

- **Primary Antagonists**: Characters who serve as the main threats throughout the series
- **Complex Antagonists/Allies**: Characters who shift between antagonist and ally roles
- **Thread Entities**: Powerful beings that exist primarily in the thread dimension

## Philosophical Integration

Each antagonist has been enhanced with philosophical depth through the integration of the twelve nidanas (links of dependent origination) from Buddhist philosophy. This adds layers of meaning to their abilities, motivations, and character arcs.
