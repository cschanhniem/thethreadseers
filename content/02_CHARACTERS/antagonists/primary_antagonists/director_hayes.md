## Background
- **Origin**: Military and intelligence background
- **Discovery**: Learned about thread seers through classified research
- **Mission**: Tasked with assessing and containing potential thread "threats"
- **Methods**: Developed technology to detect, monitor, and neutralize thread abilities

## Character Arc
- **Book 4**: Introduced as mysterious government threat
- **Book 5**: Full confrontation with Lyra's group
- **Resolution**: Exposure of illegal experimentation program
- **Legacy**: Eventually replaced by more sympathetic government liaison

## Philosophical Dimension: Nidanas

### Primary Nidana: Formations (Saṃskāra)
Hayes embodies the karmic formations that arise from ignorance. His entire worldview is shaped by institutional conditioning that sees everything as a resource to be controlled. His military background, government position, and security apparatus are all physical manifestations of these mental formations.

**Thread Manifestation**: Though unable to see threads himself, his technology that detects and disrupts them represents his attempt to force the thread dimension into his conditioned framework of control and exploitation.

**Character Challenge**: Hayes must confront how his institutional conditioning has limited his perception of reality. His greatest struggle is recognizing that his framework for understanding thread seers is fundamentally inadequate.

**Growth Arc**: 
- Book 4: Operates entirely within institutional formations
- Book 5: Confronted with thread realities that don't fit his framework
- Resolution: His defeat comes when his formations are disrupted by exposure to realities that don't fit his conditioned understanding

### Secondary Nidana: Six Sense Bases (Ṣaḍāyatana)
Hayes's reliance on technology to perceive what he cannot naturally sense represents the limitation of conventional sensory perception. His journey involves confronting the inadequacy of technological extensions of sense.

**Thread Manifestation**: His thread-detecting devices are literal attempts to expand his sensory bases to perceive what lies beyond ordinary senses.

**Character Challenge**: Recognizing that technological perception provides only limited, distorted access to thread reality.

**Growth Arc**:
- Book 4: Complete reliance on technological sensing
- Book 5: Experiences failures and limitations of his technology
- Resolution: Forced to acknowledge realities beyond what his technology can detect

### Tertiary Nidana: Ignorance (Avidyā)
Despite his intelligence and resources, Hayes operates from fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of threads and thread seers. His journey involves confronting this ignorance.

**Thread Manifestation**: His attempts to weaponize and control thread abilities reflect his ignorance of their true nature and purpose.

**Character Challenge**: Moving beyond his materialist, militaristic understanding of thread abilities.

**Growth Arc**:
- Book 4: Displays complete ignorance of thread dimension's true nature
- Book 5: Begins encountering evidence that challenges his understanding
- Resolution: Public revelation forces institutional reconfiguration that creates space for more accurate understanding

### Integration of Nidanas in Thread Work
Hayes represents how institutional formations, limited perception, and fundamental ignorance create systems of control and exploitation. His defeat demonstrates how these systems ultimately fail when confronted with realities they cannot accommodate. The sympathetic liaison who replaces him represents the possibility of new institutional formations based on more accurate understanding and expanded perception.
