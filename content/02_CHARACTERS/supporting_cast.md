# Supporting Cast

The supporting cast characters have been reorganized into a modular directory structure for better organization and easier updates. Please refer to the new structure in the `supporting_cast` directory.

## Directory Structure

- **Core Friends**: Characters who form Lyra's primary friend group
- **Secondary Friends**: Characters who provide support and additional perspectives
- **Mentors**: Characters who bring diverse philosophical perspectives
  - Eastern Philosophy Mentors
  - Religious Mentors
  - Western Philosophy Mentors

## Philosophical Integration

Each character has been enhanced with philosophical depth through the integration of the twelve nidanas (links of dependent origination) from Buddhist philosophy. This adds layers of meaning to their thread abilities, personal challenges, and growth arcs.

## Navigation
