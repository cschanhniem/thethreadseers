1. **Ignorance (Avidyā)** - Fundamental misunderstanding of reality
2. **Formations (Saṃskāra)** - Mental formations/karma created through ignorance
3. **Consciousness (Vijñāna)** - Awareness conditioned by formations
4. **Name and Form (Nāmarūpa)** - Mental and physical phenomena
5. **Six Sense Bases (Ṣaḍāyatana)** - The six senses (including mind)
6. **Contact (Sparśa)** - Encounter between sense organs and objects
7. **Feeling (Vedanā)** - Pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral sensations
8. **Craving (Tṛṣṇā)** - Desire arising from feeling
9. **Clinging (Upādāna)** - Attachment to objects of desire
10. **Becoming (Bhava)** - Process of coming into existence
11. **Birth (Jāti)** - Beginning of a new life/identity
12. **Aging and Death (Jarāmaraṇa)** - Decay and end of life/identity

Each character embodies specific nidanas that connect to their thread abilities, personal challenges, and growth arcs, creating a philosophically rich tapestry that explores the nature of reality, connection, and transformation.
