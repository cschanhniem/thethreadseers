## Philosophical Dimension: Nidanas

### Primary Nidana: Craving (Tṛṣṇā)
Aiden embodies the restless desire for advantage, opportunity, and freedom. His thread seeking ability represents his constant search for what's valuable, useful, or advantageous. His journey involves transforming selfish craving into skillful aspiration.

**Thread Manifestation**: His seeking ability allows him to locate specific threads across distances, physically manifesting his talent for finding what he desires or what others need.

**Character Challenge**: Aiden must learn to distinguish between selfish craving that leads to exploitation and skillful aspiration that serves others. His greatest struggle is overcoming his tendency to use information as a commodity for personal gain.

**Growth Arc**: 
- Book 2: Primarily uses his seeking ability for personal advantage and status
- Book 4: Faces consequences when his information trading harms friends
- Book 6: Begins using his network to help others during crisis
- Book 7: Transforms craving into skillful aspiration that serves the community while respecting boundaries

### Secondary Nidana: Six Sense Bases (Ṣaḍāyatana)
As a thread seeker, Aiden has developed an additional "sense" for locating and tracking threads. His journey involves learning to use this sense responsibly and ethically.

**Thread Manifestation**: His seeking ability functions as an extended sensory capacity, allowing him to perceive threads beyond normal range and through barriers.

**Character Challenge**: Developing ethical guidelines for when and how to use his enhanced sensory capacity, particularly regarding privacy and consent.

**Growth Arc**:
- Book 3: Uses his seeking sense with little regard for privacy or boundaries
- Book 5: Begins to establish personal ethics around information seeking
- Book 7: Creates formal protocols for ethical thread seeking that respect privacy while serving community needs

### Tertiary Nidana: Becoming (Bhava)
Aiden's constant movement and reinvention throughout childhood has given him an unusual relationship with identity and becoming. His journey involves finding a stable sense of self while maintaining his adaptability.

**Thread Manifestation**: His ability to track threads through changes and transformations represents his comfort with flux and becoming.

**Character Challenge**: Finding a consistent ethical core while maintaining the adaptability that makes him valuable.

**Growth Arc**:
- Book 2: Identity shifts opportunistically depending on what's advantageous
- Book 4: Begins to question who he wants to become beyond survival and advantage
- Book 6: Commits to a consistent ethical identity while maintaining adaptability
- Book 7: Integrates adaptability and ethical consistency in his information network

### Integration of Nidanas in Thread Work
Aiden's evolution as a thread seeker comes through transforming his relationship with these three nidanas. By bringing ethics to craving, responsibility to sensory capacity, and consistency to becoming, he develops a thread seeking approach that serves community needs while respecting boundaries. His ultimate realization is that true freedom comes not from escaping all constraints but from choosing ethical commitments that align with his deepest values.
