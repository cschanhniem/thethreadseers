# Acknowledgments

This book exists because of threads—shimmering, unbreakable—that bind me to those I love most.

To my parents, who believed from the beginning. Your unwavering support became my strongest thread, golden and true.

To Katie, my partner in every adventure—thank you for standing beside me through challenge and celebration alike. The threads between us pulse brighter with each passing day, weaving patterns I never imagined possible.

To Mia and Lana, my brilliant daughters who teach me to see the world through wonder-struck eyes—your curiosity, creativity, and boundless joy are woven into every page. May you always follow the silver threads of your dreams, wherever they lead.

And to you, dear reader, for lifting this book and joining the luminous thread that connects us all through story. Welcome to the Weave.
