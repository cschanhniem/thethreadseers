# PROLOGUE: SAIGON, 1943

The bullet whispered past Mei-Hua's ear—deadly breath seeking flesh. She didn't flinch. The threads had warned her a heartbeat before: bright, violent crimson connecting sniper to trigger, intention to consequence.

Lin Mei-Hua pressed deeper into warehouse shadows, air thick with damp sacking and something metallic—old rust or faint blood. Her brother's last words haunted her: *"If the Japanese shipping manifest reaches Tokyo, a thousand families in Chợ Lớn will starve this winter."* His message pulsed with her racing heart, tangled with the familiar ache of absence. Three months since his disappearance, and still the threads that once connected them hung broken and dark—burnt offerings swaying in memory's wind.

Below, Japanese soldiers patrolled the quays along the Saigon River. Their boots struck cobblestones in rhythmic patterns, each impact a small violence against the night. Air thick with river mud, tropical blooms, and fear bore distant sounds from Chợ Lớn, the city's sprawling Chinese quarter. To ordinary eyes: men with guns. To Mei-Hua: walking constellations trailing threads of ambition (harsh, metallic red), fear (brittle, pale yellow), and duty (rigid, grey-blue) that shimmered like gossamer in darkness.

These threads unsettled the deeper currents flowing through Hậu Giang street, Chợ Lớn's beating heart. Her grandmother had taught her to see both: threads showed bonds between people, currents carried the soul of places themselves. Tonight, those currents dragged at her senses, thick and dark with Chợ Lớn's collective sorrow, yet shot through with defiant sparks—a will not yet extinguished.

She closed her eyes, steadying herself with the breathing technique passed through generations of her family's Silk Vision tradition. *In through the nose, hold for three heartbeats, out through slightly parted lips.* A ghost-smile touched her mouth—her grandmother tapping her chest with a wooden spoon when she rushed the rhythm. When she opened her eyes again, the world revealed its layered truth, a faint hum underpinning the night's sounds, air itself thrumming against her skin.

The 丝线—silk threads—shone in vibrant spectrum, connecting person to person, object to purpose, action to consequence. Beneath them flowed Hậu Giang's currents, carrying centuries of stories, hopes, sorrows. The Japanese military headquarters pulsed with sickly yellow-green threads of control. Like infection, they stretched across Saigon, damming natural currents, particularly the vital rice flow from the Mekong Delta—now choked with the suffering of requisitioned harvests and hungry children.

And there—just as intelligence from the Cochinchina General Association had suggested—a thick cord of black-silver light ran from headquarters to a cargo ship moored at port. This thread vibrated with exploitation's purpose, carrying confiscated rice and strategic materials. A parasitic line, draining the lifeblood that Hậu Giang's currents sought to nurture.

"Do you see it? The threads, the... disturbances?" whispered Zhang, her fellow resistance fighter crouched beside her. Unable to perceive threads with her clarity, he'd learned to trust her unique sight.

"Yes." Her voice barely stirred the air. "The thread carrying stolen goods is strong. Its color resonates with greed and urgency." She traced its path, remembering another thread—a gentle green line connecting her father's calligraphy brush to the merchant licenses he'd forged, helping refugee families establish themselves in Chợ Lớn. Sometimes, even thread manipulation served harmony, not discord.

"And?" Zhang prompted, knowing her well enough to read the hesitation in her voice.

"There's an unnatural manipulation here, more than just the Japanese. The thread pattern..." She paused, recognition flickering through her mind like distant lightning. "It reminds me of Dr. Weber's work."

"The German researcher? The one who studied with your grandmother?"

Mei-Hua nodded grimly. "Before the war, he understood—truly understood—the balance between threads and currents. He even helped heal disrupted flows around the new French hospital. But after Berlin recalled him, his letters grew strange. Full of talk about 'maximizing thread potential' and 'strategic current redistribution.'"

This thread bore his signature style—precise, methodical—yet its usual warmth was gone, leaving only cold, sharp efficiency. Not merely a connection, but a conduit: actively, violently managed. Its energy felt siphoned and twisted, a corruption that ached in her heart for her grandmother's former student.

"We have fifteen minutes before the patrol returns," Zhang reminded her, checking his watch. The timepiece had been his father's—a thread of warm bronze light still connected the two, even across death's threshold.

Mei-Hua nodded and reached into her jacket, removing a small silk pouch—fabric worn smooth under her touch—embroidered with ancient symbols, her mother's last gift before fever claimed her. Inside lay tools passed down through her family for centuries. Her fingers brushed the jade needle her grandmother had given her on her sixteenth birthday, the day she'd first guided rather than forced a thread's path. Beside it, a red silk charm knotted in intricate pattern—a symbol of choices that could never be undone.

"Sometimes," her grandmother had said, eyes twinkling, "the Western ways have wisdom too. The trick is knowing when to apply precision"—she'd held up the needle—"and when to trust the currents to show the way."

She selected the jade needle, cool against her skin, and a spool of red silk thread. The thread had been soaked in herbs and a drop of her own blood during the last full moon—a practice that would have drawn scorn from Western academies, with their emphasis on sterile precision. Yet even Dr. Weber had admitted, in better days, that their clinical methods often achieved only superficial changes, missing the deeper harmonies that made true thread-work last.

"Keep watch," she whispered to Zhang. Then she began to work.

Her fingers began a delicate dance, weaving patterns taught by her grandmother—a choreography of persuasion. She didn't cut the enemy's black-silver thread; that would be blunt trauma, alerting them immediately and sending violent shockwaves through the local currents. Instead, she wove her own red silk alongside it, creating a subtle pattern of redirection, a gentle tributary.

*The art of Silk Vision is not domination, but conversation,* her grandmother had said. *We do not break the threads; we persuade them. And we always listen to the currents of the place, for they carry the wisdom of generations.*

As she worked, Mei-Hua whispered ancient verses in a dialect resonant with Chợ Lớn's history, her intention focused like sunlight through glass. The red thread began to pulse with her heartbeat—soft, warm light gradually coaxing the harsh black-silver cord without disrupting its primary flow. She was creating a fork in the path: the information would still flow to the harbor, but a copy, an echo carried on her silk, would now flow to the resistance headquarters as well, guided by the subtle currents she had aligned with.

A bead of sweat traced her temple despite the night's cool. This was delicate work, requiring her to balance the thread's integrity with surrounding currents' harmony. The Japanese had their own thread-walkers—practitioners likely German-trained in the Western tradition. They called the threads "Anima Filaments" and approached them with cold calculation, often severing and re-routing them, disregarding collateral damage to the unseen world or Hậu Giang's spirit.

Suddenly, the black-silver thread pulsed violently, and a discordant ripple spread through nearby currents. Mei-Hua froze, sharp breath caught in her throat—the sudden violence a physical jolt.

"Someone's coming," she whispered, hastily securing her work with a final, almost invisible knot of red silk. A familiar resonance in the approaching thread signature caught her breath. "No... it can't be..."

Zhang tensed beside her. "What is it?"

"Their touch—it's like Dr. Weber's, but twisted, corrupted." She frowned, fingers still hovering over her work. "The precision is there, but it's being used to strangle the currents, not work with them."

The approaching presence drew closer, bringing a surge of memories: afternoon teas with her grandmother and the German scholar, his earnest questions about current flows, his joy when he first sensed them himself. "What happened to you, old friend?" she whispered to the night.

"How long until you're finished?" Zhang's voice carried urgency's edge.

"It's done, but not as I intended. I've created the fork in the thread, but..." She swallowed hard. "There's resistance in the pattern. They'll detect it by morning, and the disturbance in the local currents will be obvious to anyone sensitive enough."

"That gives us tonight. It's enough." Zhang helped her pack away her tools, movements quick but gentle—he'd learned care after she'd scolded him for roughly handling her mother's pouch. "The elders were right to send you. A Western practitioner would have severed the thread."

Mei-Hua shook her head, a sad smile touching her lips. "Most would have, yes. But there are others..." She thought of the British anthropologist, of Dr. Weber before the war. "Some understand that true mastery comes from respect, not dominance." She tucked the pouch back into her jacket. "Though whoever is approaching now has forgotten that lesson, if they ever learned it."

As they prepared to retreat through shadows, Mei-Hua cast one last look at her handiwork. The red silk thread pulsed gently alongside the black-silver cord, nearly invisible in humid air—much like the green threads of life and commerce that still flowed through Chợ Lớn despite occupation, carrying hope and resistance in their quiet currents.

A deeper disquiet settled in her, beyond tonight's mission. Fleetingly, her sight expanded, showing not just local threads but glimmers of vast, interconnected patterns spanning continents—a tapestry of immense complexity. The Japanese occupation was but one brutal, tangled knot. And the unseen hands weaving it... cold dread touched her as she sensed some should have known better.

"We need to warn the elders," she murmured. "The balance is shifting. These new thread-walkers, with their machines and methodologies—they're pulling too much, too quickly. They don't understand how threads and currents nurture each other, how they're rooted in the hearts of communities."

Zhang gave her a concerned look but knew better than to question her sight. "First, we complete this mission. Then we warn the elders."

Mei-Hua nodded and followed him into darkness, the echo of disturbed threads and troubled currents of Hậu Giang vibrating in her consciousness. Behind them, the approaching presence grew stronger. Just before they turned the corner, she caught a glimpse of a figure on the warehouse roof—tall, European, familiar. The threads connecting them flared with recognition.

"Weber," she breathed, her heart clenching. But the currents around him felt wrong, distorted, like a beloved melody played in haunting minor key.

Her family had walked these paths of light and shadow, of thread and current, for three thousand years. They knew that knowledge without wisdom was a blade without a handle, dangerous to all it touched.

The threads belonged to no one. The currents belonged to the communities they nurtured. And both were beginning to resist.

*Seventy years later, Mei-Hua's granddaughter would tell stories to a young girl named Lyra Chen about the silk threads that connected all things and the deep currents of life that flowed through places like Chợ Lớn, binding communities and histories together—stories the Western academy, with its focus on "Anima Filaments," would dismiss as folklore until that same girl revealed abilities that would challenge everything they thought they knew about the threads that bind our world and the ancient wisdom needed to walk among them responsibly.*
