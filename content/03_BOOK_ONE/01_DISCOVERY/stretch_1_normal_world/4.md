# Chapter 4: The Invitation

> "Thread traditions are like rivers flowing to the same ocean of understanding."

Lyra sat at Nai Nai’s sun-drenched kitchen table, jasmine tea scenting the air. Her sketchbook lay open, charcoal skittering restlessly, a frantic attempt to capture the intricate, shimmering threads weaving through the room, around her grandmother, through the very air. After mending Katie and Zach’s bond, the world felt too loud, thrumming with silent energies. Her father’s dismissal—her art as “abstract,” “lacking foundation”—still stung, a fresh layer on years of feeling misunderstood. Even Ms. Rivera’s knowing glances at school, hinting at a shared secret, felt more unsettling than reassuring. Who could she possibly talk to about this overwhelming reality of the threads, the power she’d felt, the fear it ignited?

Outside Nai Nai’s window, a group of teenagers walked by, laughing, their friendship threads a tangle of bright, uncomplicated gold. Easy. Normal. Lyra watched them, a familiar ache of isolation tightening her chest. They moved through the world untroubled by the shimmering energies she perceived. One boy paused, head tilted as if listening to something only he could hear, while a girl in the group seemed to radiate emotions in waves of color that Lyra suspected no one else noticed. They were different, too, in their own ways, yet they belonged. Lyra sighed and turned back to her page, to the secret world only she inhabited so fully.

"Your mother used to see them too, you know."

The words, delicate as incense smoke, lingered. Jasmine-scented air. Saturday afternoon shattered. A veil lifted from a world Lyra had always sensed. A truth she’d never dared name.

Her pencil stilled mid-stroke. Only moments before, she’d been trying to capture the luminous tapestry around her grandmother: the warm 金缘丝 (jīn yuán sī—golden affinity threads) that tethered Nai Nai to her ancient porcelain teapot; the silvery 记忆丝 (jì yì sī—memory threads) that shimmered around faded photographs like captured moonlight; even the sturdy 习惯丝 (xí guàn sī—habit threads) that anchored her to the worn kitchen chair, her sunrise spot. It was a vibrant, silent language she had always perceived but never spoken of—a language that now, terrifyingly, had a name.

Her heart hammered like a frantic bird beating against her ribs. "What… what did you say, Nai Nai?"

Anmei Chen—Nai Nai—steeped tea, a ritual of ten thousand repetitions. Her movements rippled the threads around her as jasmine scent coiled, carrying memories, a continuity of moments like pearls on silver.

"The threads," Nai Nai continued. Her voice was steady as she poured tea into delicate cups. "Your mother saw them from childhood. As you do."

A thousand questions swarmed Lyra. All these years hiding her sight, pretending not to notice the 友谊丝 (yǒuyì sī—friendship threads) between classmates—vibrant copper or fragile spider silk; the 家族丝 (family bonds)—luminous silver to tarnished gray; the complex webs defining every social space. Nai Nai knew?

"Why didn't you tell me?" The question, sharper than intended, cut the air.

Nai Nai's hands stilled. "I needed to be certain. Thread sight manifests differently across generations. Some see only certain types. Others perceive through sound or touch, not sight." She studied Lyra's face. "But your drawings—they show what your mother saw. 全谱丝线视觉 (quán pǔ sī xiàn shì jué—full-spectrum silk vision)."

"Is that what it's called? This... seeing?" Lyra’s voice was barely a breath.

"In our tradition, yes." Nai Nai’s eyes softened. "Other cultures have different names, different approaches. 万流归海 (wàn liú guī hǎi)—ten thousand streams return to the sea. All thread traditions are different paths to the same truth."

The mention of her mother triggered a memory, vivid and sudden—one of the few clear recollections Lyra had from before Lin Chen's disappearance. She was seven, sitting cross-legged on the floor of her mother's studio, watching her work. The memory had a peculiar quality, as if preserved in amber, every detail crystalline:

*"What are you painting, Mama?" she'd asked. Her mother's brush danced across the canvas, leaving trails of silver-blue light.*

*"What I see," her mother had replied, smiling. "The threads that connect everything. One day, you might see them too."*

*"I already do." The secret spilled out. "Golden ones between friends. Silver ones in our family. Are they real?"*

*Her mother's brush stilled. She knelt beside Lyra. Eyes bright with unshed tears. "Yes, little one. They're real. And you have a special gift—to see what others can't."*

*"Will you teach me about them?"*

*"When you're older. There's much to learn. The eye sees the ripple, but the hand feels the tide."*

*That night, Lyra fell asleep watching the threads connecting her to her mother. A brilliant, pulsing silver cord. It seemed to sing with its own inner light. Three months later, Lin Chen vanished. That silver thread dimmed to a faint, ghostly filament, stretching away into nothingness. An ache that never truly healed.*

The realization struck Lyra with fresh force: her mother hadn't just seen the threads; she'd actively worked with them, had promised to teach Lyra. A promise, and a teacher, stolen by an unknown darkness.

Lyra leaned forward, her words quick, almost breathless. "What happened to her, Nai Nai? What path was she on?"

Nai Nai was silent for a long moment, the threads around her dimming, tinged with twilight blue. "She found something," she finally said, her voice a near whisper. "Worrisome. She came here late one night, five years ago, eyes wild with fear and resolve. She showed me a map: silver-blue threads converging north, near Canada."

"The map threads were real?" Lyra whispered.

"For Silk Vision, the boundary between drawn and seen blurs." Nai Nai’s voice was soft. "Your mother's sketchbooks weren't just art. They were records of the thread dimension."

"Thread dimension?" The term, unfamiliar, resonated with a strange pull.

"The realm where threads originate and return," Nai Nai explained, hands weaving invisible patterns in the air, mimicking the flow she described. "It's not separate from our world, Lyra, but layered within it, like water flowing unseen through deep earth, only to surface as a clear spring. Your mother believed this dimension was awakening, evolving—that it wasn't just a passive network of connections, but a vast, living consciousness responding to how we engage with its fabric."

"共融，不是控制 (gòng róng, bú shì kòng zhì)," Nai Nai continued, her voice taking on a resonant timbre that seemed to echo with ancient certainty. "Communion, not control. This was your mother's core belief, her guiding principle. The threads, she said, respond to relationship, to respect, far more profoundly than they do to attempts at domination. This is the fundamental ethical choice at the heart of all thread sight: do we approach the Weave as a resource to be plundered, or as a sacred relationship to be nurtured?"

Lyra absorbed this. It connected to her own experiences. The threads did seem to respond to her attention, brightening when she focused. Sometimes even shifting slightly when she concentrated. She remembered the friendship thread between Katie and Zach. It had seemed almost to welcome her touch, to participate in its own healing.

"Is that why it felt... different? When I fixed the thread between my classmates? Like it wasn't just me doing something *to* the thread, but the thread working *with* me?"

Nai Nai's eyes brightened. "Yes. Exactly. Western traditions often speak of 'manipulation'—a word about control. Our tradition speaks of '共舞' (gòng wǔ)—dancing together. The thread has its own... not consciousness, exactly. But intention. When you work *with* that intention, not against it, the results are more harmonious. More lasting."

Nai Nai rose, silk slippers whispering on wooden floor. She moved to an ornate wooden cabinet—a bridge between worlds, with its Chinese carvings and mixed Eastern and Western objects, much like Nai Nai herself. From a hidden drawer, she retrieved a small mother-of-pearl inlaid box, its pattern shifting like threads.

"Cultural Revolution," Nai Nai said, returning. "Our family's thread knowledge books were destroyed. Thread seers were considered superstitious, dangerous. My mother preserved wisdom in decorative patterns—embroidery, carvings, toys." She opened the box. Inside lay a small jade pendant on a silver chain. "Your mother's."

The silver inlay was extraordinary. Interlocking spirals. Flowing threads emanating from a central point. A design that resonated with a deep, instinctual part of Lyra. Her fingers brushed the cool jade. The familiar kitchen around her wavered. Colors bled like watercolors. The comforting scents of jasmine, sandalwood, Nai Nai's ginger-citrus perfume—they intensified, then fractured. Replaced by a cascade of new sensations: the sharp tang of petrichor; the dry whisper of ancient paper; the metallic bite of silver polish; the cool breath of old stone.

Before her inner eye, a building coalesced—not gradually, but snapping into focus like a suddenly remembered dream. Stone and glass, its very architecture infused with threads, silver-blue energy pulsing visibly through its structure. Massive wooden doors, intricately carved with the same spiraling symbol as the pendant, dominated its entrance. Above them, elegant script shimmered: "Threadweaver Academy."

The vision fractured, then dissolved. Lyra blinked, the scent of jasmine and tea reasserting itself. "I saw… a building," she said, her voice hushed.

"The Academy." Nai Nai nodded, her expression serene. "The pendant is a key, Lyra. A connection. And the threads remember, even across vast distances."

"The threads... remember?" Lyra’s eyes widened.

"织物记得 (zhì wù jì dé)," Nai Nai confirmed, her voice resonating softly. "The Weave remembers. Every interaction leaves an impression. Nothing is truly lost; it is only transformed."

Back in Nai Nai's kitchen, Lyra stared at the pendant. "Threadweaver Academy?" she repeated.

"A school for people like you, and like your mother," Nai Nai explained. "Seers who need training."

"Others see what I see?" The question was a whisper of disbelief.

"Not exactly. Thread sight varies. Some see only certain types. Others perceive through sound or touch. Your mother's vision—and yours, it seems—is comprehensive. Our tradition calls it 全谱丝线视觉—Full-Spectrum Silk Vision."

All her life, she had been alone in her perception. And now this? Others? A school? The thoughts spun, thrilling and overwhelming.

"Mom's sketchbooks," Lyra breathed. "You said records. Maybe they'll help."

Nai Nai nodded. "Kept them safe. Your father doesn't know." She retrieved a worn leather satchel. "From her studio, when she disappeared. I took them before the police came."

Lyra accepted it. Hands trembling. Three sketchbooks. Their leather covers felt cool, smooth beneath her fingertips. She opened the largest. Gasped.

Page after page revealed thread drawings—intricate, beautiful, and annotated in English and Chinese. Experimental techniques for redirecting, strengthening, and healing threads filled the pages.

Mid-book, she found the building from her vision. "Threadweaver Academy," her mother had written. "Founded 1798 - North America's oldest thread seer institution." Gold-silver threads flowed into it on the page, with a note: "Detection network - how they find us."

In the margin, a tiny, smudged sketch—dark, menacing, blurring into threads. Beside it, two words: *"Beware the Silver Shadow."*

"Lyra." Nai Nai's voice, suddenly taut, cut through her absorption. A cream envelope lay on the table, sealed with dark red wax that radiated fine lines. "This arrived."

"For me? How?"

"Thread workers find each other. Especially potent gifts." Nai Nai handed it over.

The envelope hummed with energy. Lyra broke the seal, unfolded thick parchment. Elegant script:

*Dear Miss Chen,*
*Your rare perspective, your ability to perceive connections, is a gift deserving nurture.*
*Visit Threadweaver Academy. Others share your vision. Founded 1798, our institution guides seers. Our Berkshire Mountains campus, a sanctuary to explore the tapestry.*
*Curriculum: visualization, classification, manipulation, ethics. Faculty share your gift. We honor diverse global traditions, provide structured growth.*
*Informational gathering: Saturday, 2 PM, Iris Bookstore & Cafe, 12 Willow Creek Lane. Your grandmother, Mrs. Anmei Chen, will facilitate. Bring this letter, an open mind, questions. The pendant is your credential.*
*We look forward to welcoming you.*
*Sincerely,*
*Professor Eleanor Weaver*
*Headmistress*

Lyra read it twice, her hands shaking. Hope, sharp and dizzying, warred with a cold dread. An Academy. Others who saw. A chance to understand, to learn. But then there was the smudged warning in her mother’s sketchbook: *"Beware the Silver Shadow."* Her mother had attended this Academy, delved into this world, and vanished. The stakes weren't merely about understanding a strange ability. They were about uncovering a truth that might be dangerous—a truth that had already cost her mother everything.

"Thread sight? That's its name?" she finally managed. The words felt foreign on her tongue.

"In English, yes. Our family tradition is more specific: 丝线视觉. It's not just seeing, but understanding connections—their strength, purpose, and health."

"This school—they teach this?" Lyra’s voice was small.

"Yes. Your mother attended briefly. She found their approach too... Western. Focused on control, not harmony. But she kept connections there, especially with a Professor Chen—no relation to us."

"What do you mean by 'control, not harmony'?"

Nai Nai’s smile faded, her brow furrowing as she chose her words carefully. "Western thread traditions often approach the threads as resources to be manipulated, controlled. Our tradition sees them as living connections to be understood, harmonized with. 线贼 (xiàn zéi—thread thieves)—that is what my mother denounced: those who take without understanding, extract without exchange."

The term sent a chill through Lyra. "Thread thieves?"

"Those who use thread knowledge without respecting its source or purpose." Nai Nai’s voice lost some of its gentle cadence. "The Academy has improved since your mother's time, but it still carries this Western tendency to control rather than commune."

Lyra looked from the letter to the sketchbooks, the jade pendant warm in her palm. A thousand questions still swirled, but one surfaced.

"Mom's disappearance. Is this connected?"

Nai Nai’s gaze dropped to her hands, clasped in her lap. Her voice grew low, heavy with memory. "Your mother discovered something important about the thread dimension. Something others might have wanted to suppress. Her last message to me spoke of 'patterns of decay,' of 'institutional blindness.' She planned to present her findings to the Thread Council. She disappeared the night before she was due to speak."

"Thread Council?" Lyra echoed.

"A global governing body for seers, independent of Threadweaver, though connected." Nai Nai gestured to the invitation. "This is your chance to learn more, to understand what happened."

Lyra stared at the letter. Terror gripped her—her mother had vanished into this unknown world. Yet, a thrill coursed through her—answers, understanding, belonging.

"Dad?" she asked. "He doesn't know I see threads."

"It is time he knew. Protecting you with ignorance hasn't worked. Your abilities are growing. You need training."

---

Her father arrived that evening, rain-damp, the scent of wet wool and city streets clinging to him, tired from faculty meetings. His expression shifted from polite greeting to alarm when he saw the sketchbooks spread on the table and the official-looking envelope of the invitation. Nai Nai held the jade pendant in her open palm.

"What is all this?" His voice, tight with fear, was directed at Nai Nai. His gaze flickered to Lyra.

"She knows, Alexander," Nai Nai said calmly. Her voice, a steady anchor in the suddenly turbulent room. "About the threads. About Lin."

The fight seemed to drain out of him. His shoulders sagged, the sharp lines of his face softening into unfamiliar weariness. He sank into a nearby chair as if his legs could no longer support the weight of this revealed truth. Suddenly, he looked years older, academic precision momentarily erased by a father’s profound, resurfaced grief. "I thought... I had hoped it would fade," he said, voice barely a whisper, not looking at Lyra. "Lin's did, for a while, when she was a teen. Then it came back, stronger, when she went to college. I prayed you would be different."

"You knew?" Lyra’s words were a choked whisper, each syllable edged with betrayal. "All this time, you knew what I was seeing?"

"I suspected." His eyes were haunted. "The signs—your stares, your drawings with their unexplainable details. I didn't want to believe it. The thread world took your mother, Lyra. I was trying to protect you."

"By keeping me ignorant? Making me think I was crazy? Alone?" The words burst out. "Do you have any idea what that's been like?"

"You could have talked to me," Nai Nai interjected gently.

"I didn't know!" Frustration spilled from Lyra. "No one told me!"

Her father reached for her hand, but she pulled away. "Lyra, please. After your mother... I was terrified. The police found nothing. She just vanished. The only connection was her research into thread dimension anomalies. I couldn't risk losing you too."

"So you let me think I was alone." Her voice broke. "That no one else saw what I saw."

Heavy silence filled the room. The afternoon light shifted, casting long shadows. The threads between them—family bonds, stretched by secrets and fear—pulsed with a shared, palpable pain.

Nai Nai spoke into the quiet. "What is done is done. What next?" She nodded to the invitation. "Threadweaver offers Lyra understanding, and others like her. She should go to the meeting."

Her father looked at the invitation, then at Lyra's determined face. "I don't trust them. The Academy has its own agenda. But..." He let out a deep sigh. "Keeping you in the dark hasn't worked. You deserve answers."

"So I can go? Bookstore meeting?"

"We'll go. Together. Want to hear what they say." He picked up the invitation. "Professor Weaver. New since your mother's time. Don't know her."

"You've been there? To the Academy?" Lyra asked, surprised.

"Once or twice. When I was visiting your mother. I couldn't see the threads, of course. I just saw the buildings, met the people." A ghost of a smile touched his lips. "Your mother tried to describe it all to me. I never fully understood. But I loved watching her face light up when she talked about it."

A pang, sharp and sudden, tightened Lyra’s chest—a fierce longing for the mother she barely remembered, and for the stories he might tell. "I want to know everything," she said. "What she saw, what she discovered."

"The eye sees the ripple, but the hand feels the tide," Nai Nai said softly, echoing the words from Lyra's memory. "Your mother's favorite saying. Seeing threads is just the beginning. Understanding them—that is the true journey."

As they prepared to leave for the bookstore meeting, Nai Nai took Lyra's hand and gently pressed the jade pendant into her palm. "Keep this close, child. It belonged to your mother, and her mother before her. In our family, thread sight passes from mother to daughter, along with the responsibility to use it wisely."

"What responsibility?"

"To see what others cannot. To mend what is broken. To protect the Weave from those who would exploit it." Nai Nai’s eyes, dark and deep as ancient wells, held the reflection of ages. "The threads remember, Lyra. And now, so must you."

Lyra felt the weight of those words, the responsibility they carried. It wasn't just about having a special ability—it was about using that ability ethically, with respect for the connections she could perceive and alter. The pendant felt heavier in her palm, not just with physical weight but with the inheritance of generations of thread seers who had faced this same question: how to use their gift with wisdom.

"What if I make a mistake?" she asked, voicing the fear that had been growing since she'd first consciously manipulated the thread between Katie and Zach. "What if I change something I shouldn't?"

"That is why we learn," Nai Nai said gently. "That is why we study the traditions of those who came before us. No thread seer is born knowing all the answers. But the question itself—that concern for the consequences of your actions—that is the beginning of wisdom."
