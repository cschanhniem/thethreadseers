## THE GATHERING

The Iris Bookstore & Cafe, usually a sanctuary redolent of old paper and quiet page-turns, now thrummed. Nervous energy prickled Lyra's skin—a palpable crucible of anticipation and unspoken anxieties. She sat wedged between her father's skeptical stillness and Nàinai's knowing calm. The faint scent of her grandmother's jasmine tea was a fragile anchor in the charged air. On a small stage stood Headmistress Eleanor Weaver. Lyra saw her personal threads weave a remarkable tapestry: deep forest greens, the diamond-sharp clarity of winter starlight. Her voice, when she spoke, resonated with those same qualities—reassuring warmth and undeniable authority. She painted Threadweaver Academy as a haven for those, like Lyra, who perceived the world's hidden symphony of connections.

"A gift," Headmistress Weaver said, her gaze sweeping the gathered families, "and a responsibility. One we learn to carry, to nurture. The wise artist trusts the vision, even when the full picture remains unclear."

Nàinai nodded, her eyes meeting Lyra's over the rim of her teacup, the porcelain warm between her fingers. Anmei Chen's threads were a familiar comfort: strong 家族丝 (jiā zú sī—family threads) of resilient silver, warm 友谊丝 (yǒu yì sī—friendship threads) like spun sunlight, and deeper, foundational 祖先丝 (zǔ xiān sī—ancestral threads) in jade and amber, holding the quiet weight of generational wisdom.

Lyra's gaze drifted to Professor Harlow, an immobile figure at the stage's edge. When their eyes met, a shiver traced Lyra’s spine—not of cold, but of something else, a dissonant chord struck within the Weave. His threads were unnervingly muted, almost deliberately veiled, yet she sensed a predatory stillness beneath, a coiled intensity reminiscent of their encounter after the Madison incident. The jade pendant from Nàinai felt suddenly leaden, a ward against an unseen current.

"Our purpose," Headmistress Weaver continued, voice imbued with quiet passion, "not to hand you a map, but to provide compass, sextant, sturdy vessel to navigate yourselves. We furnish tools, historical context, knowledge, and crucially, the ethical framework for your own understanding. *To truly know the threads is to touch the sacred, inescapable truth that all life is one.*"

Lyra felt her father shift beside her—a minute tightening around his eyes, the almost imperceptible flicker of a skeptical thread pulsing between his brows. The Academy's approach to thread knowledge, as Weaver described it, felt systematic, institutional—a world away from Nàinai's organic, cultural understanding. She could almost hear the echo of her grandmother’s gentle distinctions: Western academia valuing classification, measurement, replication; the Chinese silk-seeing tradition emphasizing relationship, harmony, context. Two ways of knowing the same reality, yet fundamentally different paths.

The jade pendant felt warm against her skin, as if responding to her thoughts. Knowledge wasn't neutral; it came embedded in cultural frameworks, philosophical assumptions. The Academy's "ethical framework" would inevitably reflect its institutional values. Would they teach her to control threads or to commune with them? To categorize connections or to honor their inherent wisdom?

A sickening thud. The sound echoed flatly, shattering the quiet of the suddenly hushed room.

## THE INCIDENT

A few rows ahead, a boy—older, a Westbrook High senior, his aura once a vibrant blue-green of intellect and nature-love—crumpled. He sprawled on the Persian rug, limbs askew, face ghastly white. A collective gasp stole the room's air.

Even as Lyra's sight flared, an almost physical lurch towards the fallen boy, she registered other distinct reactions in the erupting chaos, the air suddenly thick with the coppery, metallic scent of raw fear. Nearby, a girl with kind, anxious eyes (Lyra had vaguely noticed her earlier, her personal threads a calm, steady sky-blue) gasped, a sharp, audible intake of breath, her hand flying to her chest as if Ben’s fall had dealt her a physical blow. The girl’s threads blazed with painful, empathetic light; she took an instinctive step forward before adults converged, a wall of bodies blocking her path. Beside her, a dark-haired boy winced sharply, hands clapping over his ears for a fleeting second, his face contorting as if from a piercing, high-frequency sound that vibrated just beyond Lyra's normal hearing but resonated jarringly within the Weave. His threads, usually a complex swirl of indigo and silver, momentarily shattered into sharp, discordant notes. A third figure, a lean, intense-looking boy Lyra hadn't consciously noted before, seemed to ignore Ben entirely, his sharp, unnervingly analytical gaze riveted on Headmistress Weaver, then Professor Harlow. His threads, a precise, almost crystalline structure of clear light, seemed to intensify, as if cataloging every adult reaction, every micro-expression with cold precision.

Amidst the panicked, fraying 恐惧丝 (kǒng jù sī—fear threads) of the crowd, one horrific thread connected to Ben pulsed with sickening clarity in Lyra's vision. A color she’d never catalogued. Never conceived. Not the silver of illness (疾病丝 - jí bìng sī). Not the grey of despair (绝望丝 - jué wàng sī). This was an ashen black-silver, like tarnished metal or the cold, dead light of a collapsed star. Devoid of life. It seemed to *devour* light from the boy's other, rapidly dimming threads. A pure, horrifying negation. What Nai Nai’s whispered stories might term 虚无丝 (xū wú sī—void threads).

Frantic energy erupted in the bookstore. Parents surged forward, their voices sharp with alarm. Headmistress Weaver, her own threads a brilliant, protective gold, moved swiftly towards Ben, her face a mask of composure. "Space, please," she commanded, her voice slicing through the panic. "Someone call Westbrook's nurse."

The bookstore's bell jangled harshly as the door was thrust open. A tall young man, face a thundercloud, strode in, bringing with him the damp, earthy smell of recent rain, his threads a chaotic storm of jagged crimson and agitated violet. Dayo Okafor, Lyra vaguely recalled—Westbrook's fiery debater.

"Not another one!" Dayo's voice was raw. "Third this week! Maya, Sam, now Ben! What in the Weave's name is happening?" His furious gaze found Headmistress Weaver. "'Exam stress' again?"

The accusation hung in the air, thick and heavy as storm clouds, pregnant with unspoken fear. Three collapses. A pattern. A cold dread, like icy water, snaked down Lyra's spine as the ashen black-silver thread on Ben pulsed in her mind's eye.

A subtle shift occurred; the ambient thread-hum abruptly quieted. Professor Harlow glided from the stage's edge with unnerving, fluid grace. His aura—Lyra's stomach clenched—was almost invisible. Not calm, like Weaver's controlled power, but deliberately muted, a heavily redacted document, impossible to truly *perceive*. A visual black hole absorbing light, revealing nothing. His sharp, penetrating eyes fixed on Ben with an intensity devoid of compassion.

Professor Harlow moved past Dayo and Weaver as if they were inconvenient statues, the subtle scent of old books and something indefinably sterile clinging to him, a scent that made Lyra’s nose twitch. He knelt beside Ben, his movements economical, precise. "Youthful overexcitement, I suspect," Harlow murmured, the low thrum of his voice vibrating along Lyra's own threads like a plucked, discordant string, the sound almost lost in the lingering, acrid scent of fear that now permeated the room. His gaze wasn't on Ben's pale face but fixed just above his chest—where Lyra saw the horrifying ashen black-silver thread pulse weakly, a dying star.

Harlow's slender hand reached out, fingers brushing Ben's forehead. Lyra’s entire being narrowed to that point of contact. She saw Harlow's muted threads extend—not the warm light of 治愈丝 (zhì yù sī—healing threads), but something cold, imbued with surgical intent. One grey, almost invisible filament of Harlow's energy touched the ashen black-silver tendril.

No sound. No flash. Yet Lyra *felt* the severance in her own core—a sickening lurch. The ashen black-silver thread didn't detach. It *snapped*. Fractured into a million dying embers. Then winked out of existence. Extinguished. A brutal efficiency. It mirrored the forbidden 断丝术 (duàn sī shù—thread severing technique) Nai Nai had only ever whispered about with dread.

Ben gasped, a shudder racking his frame. His eyes fluttered open. Color, faint but definite, seeped back into his cheeks. Dazed, confused, but undeniably alive.

Harlow rose smoothly, his own silver pendant—a complex, almost thorny design—gleaming faintly for a split second before stilling against his dark shirt. A thin, dismissive smile touched his lips. "As I said. Overwrought. Perfectly fine."


But then something shifted in his expression. The clinical mask slipped for just a moment, revealing something raw and painful beneath. He approached her slowly, deliberately, footsteps silent on the Persian rug.

"You have your mother's eyes," he said quietly, his voice barely audible above the lingering murmur of concerned parents. The words hit Lyra like a physical blow.

"You knew her?" The question escaped before she could stop it.

Harlow's smile turned bitter, tinged with old grief. "Lin Chen was... extraordinary. She always said her daughter would be too." His gaze swept over Lyra's sketchbook, still clutched in her trembling hands. "She was right, it seems."

"How did you—"

"We were research partners, once. Before you were born. Before she chose..." He paused, his jaw tightening almost imperceptibly. "Before she chose the threads over everything else."

The jade pendant at Lyra's throat grew warm, as if responding to some unseen current. Nàinai had given it to her for protection, but protection from what? From whom?

"She spoke of you often," Harlow continued, voice dropping to barely a whisper. "Even at the end, when the thread dimension was calling to her, she worried about the daughter she would leave behind. About the gift you would inherit. About the price you would pay."

*The price you would pay.* The words echoed in Lyra's mind, connecting to her father's deteriorating condition with horrible clarity. Had her mother known? Had she foreseen what Lyra's awakening would cost?

"Professor Harlow," Headmistress Weaver's voice cut through the moment like a blade. "Perhaps we should focus on the immediate situation."

Harlow straightened, the mask sliding back into place with practiced ease. But his eyes remained fixed on Lyra, and in them she saw something that chilled her to the bone—not malice, but a kind of desperate, protective intensity that reminded her uncomfortably of her father's expression when he looked at her now.

"Of course," he said smoothly. "The boy is fine. Just a momentary... overexcitement."

But as he turned away, Lyra caught his final words, spoken so softly she almost missed them: "I won't let you make her mistakes, Lin. Not this time."

Lyra shivered. The jade pendant felt cold against her skin, a stark warning. Whatever game Harlow was playing, she was now a piece on his board. The 警告丝 (jǐng gào sī—warning thread) between them pulsed with cold, blue light—a connection neither wanted but both now acknowledged.

But worse than that was the growing certainty that Harlow's interest in her wasn't random. He had loved her mother. He had lost her to the threads. And now he was looking at Lyra with the same desperate intensity—the look of a man determined not to lose someone again, no matter the cost.

As her father helped her to her feet, Lyra's mind reeled. Harlow had severed the thread without hesitation—clinical, efficient, brutal.

The real battle was just beginning.

*That evening, across campus in the restricted archives, Milo's fingers traced a date that made his blood run cold: Kyoto, 1997. The photograph beneath showed the aftermath of a dimensional collapse—and standing in the wreckage, a younger Marcus Harlow.*

*"Lyra needs to see this," he whispered.*
