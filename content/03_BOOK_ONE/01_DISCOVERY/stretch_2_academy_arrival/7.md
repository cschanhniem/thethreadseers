# Chapter 7: The Father's Shadow

Sterile, unforgiving light drenched the Academy’s clinic hallway, reflecting harshly off polished linoleum. Elena Blackwood leaned against the cool, unyielding wall, antiseptic scent biting sharply at her nostrils. A few doors down, Priya, a first-year, was finally settling. Her ragged breathing evened out. Her threads, once a frantic, chaotic tangle of shock-white and fear-grey from a misfired shielding exercise, now subsided to bruised lavender and pale blue.

Blackwood had found Priya hyperventilating, tears etching clean paths down her dusty cheeks, salty scent mingling with pervasive antiseptic air. The girl was convinced she’d permanently crippled her thread-sight—a common terror that tightened Elena's own chest with a phantom ache of remembered fear from her own early days. Elena’s soothing, modulated tones, pitched just above a whisper, had guided the girl through a simple grounding technique: re-threading sensory inputs—the cool, smooth floor beneath her, the thrum of her own pulse against her fingertips, the precise geometric pattern of acoustic ceiling tiles. Standard procedure for a senior of her aptitude, executed with flawless precision.

A flicker of movement at her periphery: Nurse Thorne bustled past, the crisp rustle of her uniform a familiar sound, her threads a no-nonsense, efficient weave of starched white and sensible brown. "Thanks for that, Blackwood," Thorne said, her tone brisk but not unkind. "She was quite hysterical. Some aren't prepared for the… intensity."

"Happy to help, Nurse Thorne," Elena replied, her smile polite, practiced. "She just needed a steady hand."

Thorne nodded, already halfway to the dispensary. "Well, you have that. More than some of the instructors, if I'm honest." A wry glance back. "Don't tell Professor Harlow I said that."

The mention of Harlow's name sent a chill through the hallway that had nothing to do with the air conditioning. Even Priya, half-conscious in her recovery, seemed to shiver.

Elena offered another small, noncommittal smile. As Thorne disappeared, Elena pushed herself off the wall. The hallway was momentarily empty. Her gaze flickered to the med console outside Priya’s room. It was an older model, scheduled for an upgrade next term. Less secure.

Her movements: fluid, economical, almost imperceptible. Like a shadow detaching from the wall. One hand, gloved in thin, non-conductive silk, steadied against the console. Nimble fingers, equally gloved, ghosted over the access panel. A tiny, wafer-thin data chip—smooth and cool even through the silk—slipped from her palm. It entered a nearly invisible maintenance slit with a faint click, a sound swallowed by the hallway's low hum. A sound only she would register. Encoded with a cloaking weave of her own design, it would bypass scans. Download specific diagnostic logs on thread degradation or severance. Then self-erase within twelve hours.

Her other hand, wearing the simple silk charm—a gift, she claimed, from a distant relative—brushed the console’s surface. The charm, woven from twilight-colored threads that felt soft against her skin, pulsed with faint, imperceptible warmth. A silent acknowledgment.

*Information is power,* Lord Kaelen’s voice echoed in her memory, smooth as spun silk, cold as a winter dawn. *And power, my dear Elena, is merely a tool. Its morality is defined by its wielder.*

She’d wrestled with Kaelen's pronouncement for years, the words a recurring echo in the quiet chambers of her mind. Here, at Threadweaver, knowledge was ostensibly for enlightenment, for universal betterment—a noble facade she'd once believed. Yet she’d seen the fissures, felt the subtle dissonances in the Academy's harmonious self-portrait: the whispers in shadowed alcoves, the redacted files in the deeper archives, the casual, arrogant dismissal of traditions deemed 'unscientific' by minds too rigid to perceive their value. The Academy, for all its proclaimed wisdom, felt like a monument to selective memory, its gleaming foundations cemented with forgotten histories and silenced voices. Harlow, she thought with a familiar twist of disdain, a brilliant, dangerous blunt instrument, utterly convinced of his own righteousness. Weaver, wise perhaps, but hamstrung by Council inertia, presided over a system that often felt more like a gilded cage than a sanctuary of true understanding. The silk charm on her wrist, a tangible link to one such forgotten tradition, pulsed with warmth—a silent, constant protest.

And the students—children, mostly—were caught in currents far deeper, far more treacherous than they imagined. Like Priya, overwhelmed by the Weave’s raw power, offered only sterile institutional platitudes instead of genuine ancestral wisdom. Like her younger sister Elara, somewhere in the Academy's halls, trusting that the adults around her would keep her safe.

Elena’s expression softened infinitesimally as she glanced towards Priya’s door. The girl’s threads were settling into a more restful, healing pattern. A genuine flicker of compassion, instantly shuttered—a dangerous indulgence. Compassion was a vulnerability, a thread easily pulled, easily exploited. Yet, the burning desire to see true, uncorrupted knowledge restored, to hear the silenced traditions speak again with their authentic voices—that was a different, fiercer kind of fire, one that fueled her every clandestine move.

She straightened. Her public mask clicked firmly into place, its slight pressure familiar. The chip was secure. The charm on her wrist, cool again against her skin. Just another concerned senior student helping out in the clinic. Nothing more.

She walked away, her soft-soled shoes making no sound on the polished linoleum, leaving no trace of her true purpose. The sterile lights of the hallway seemed to watch her, their hum a low, impassive, and unknowing drone.

*Meanwhile, in Professor Harlow's Office*

The cherry blossom drawing lay on Professor Harlow's desk, its edges worn soft from years of desperate handling. Five pink petals, rendered in a seven-year-old's hopeful strokes. *"For Daddy, so you remember spring when you're working too late."*

But Marcus Harlow wasn't in his office. He was back in Kyoto, fifteen years ago, his knees grinding against broken glass and scattered earth as he cradled what remained of his world.

The acrid stench of ozone still burned his nostrils—that particular reek of thread-weapons discharge mixed with the sickly-sweet smoke of burning jasmine. The Syndicate's calling card. They always left jasmine burning at their kill sites, a mockery of beauty amid devastation. His hands, slick with blood that wasn't his own, trembled as he pressed them against the gaping wound in Mei's chest where the thread-blade had torn through her small body.

*Three minutes.* The emergency alert had reached him three minutes too late. Three minutes that might as well have been eternity.

"Mei-chan," he whispered, his voice breaking like a child's. "Daddy's here. Daddy's here now." But her dark eyes—so like Aiko's, so full of trust and wonder just that morning when she'd braided cherry blossoms in her hair—stared sightless at the sky. Her small hand still clutched the drawing she'd made for him, the one with five pink petals and careful seven-year-old letters: *"For Daddy, so you remember spring when you're working too late."* The paper was soaked crimson now, her love letter transformed into evidence of his failure.

A soft knock interrupted his reverie. "Professor?" A student's voice, tentative through the heavy oak door. "I'm sorry to bother you, but I think I made a mistake in my thread-mapping exercise."

Harlow carefully folded the drawing, slipping it into his desk drawer beside a small jade figurine—Mei's favorite toy, a laughing dragon she'd named Kibo. Hope. The irony still cut like a blade. "Come in, Miss Chen."

The girl entered, clutching her assignment with trembling hands. Sarah Chen, no relation to the other Chen family he'd been tracking, but her thread signature bore the telltale shimmer of natural sensitivity. Her work showed promise, if properly guided. If protected from the fate that had claimed his daughter.

*She's about the same age Mei would be now.* The thought struck him like a physical blow, stealing his breath. Twenty-two. Mei would have been twenty-two, perhaps standing in this very office as a graduate student, her eyes bright with the same eager curiosity that had made her ask endless questions about the threads she could almost see.

For a moment, the girl's face seemed to shift, becoming smaller, younger, framed by dark hair with cherry blossoms braided through it. *"Daddy, why do some people glow and others don't? Can you teach me to see the pretty lights too?"*

*This one is the same age Mei was when they killed her,* he realized with a start that felt like ice water in his veins. *Sixteen. Vulnerable. Gifted. Everything they hunt.*

*I won't lose another daughter.* The vow crystallized in his chest like ice. *Not to them. Not ever again.*

"I tried to strengthen the connection between these two subjects," she said, spreading her sketches on his desk. "But something went wrong. The thread... it felt like it was fighting me."

Harlow studied her work. The girl had attempted to force a bond between incompatible energies—a common mistake, but one that could have dangerous consequences if left uncorrected. Her natural instincts were sound, but her technique needed refinement.

"Show me," he said quietly, his voice gentler than his usual lecture tone.

Sarah hesitated, then extended her awareness toward the practice threads woven into the office's ambient field. Harlow watched her work, noting the way she approached the connections with respect rather than dominance. Good. The Eastern traditions had taught her well, even if she didn't realize it.

"Stop," he said as her energy began to strain against the thread's natural resistance. "You're trying to impose your will. The thread has its own wisdom. Listen to what it's telling you."

"But the textbook says—"

"The textbook," Harlow interrupted, "was written by people who never learned to hear the Weave's voice." He moved beside her, his own threads extending with practiced precision. "Feel this."

His energy touched the resistant connection, not forcing but coaxing, finding the natural harmony point where the two subjects could genuinely bond. The thread brightened, settling into a stable configuration.

Sarah gasped. "It's like... like it wanted to connect that way all along."

"Precisely." Harlow withdrew his influence, watching the girl's wonder with something that might have been paternal pride. "The Weave is not our enemy to be conquered, Miss Chen. It is a partner in a dance we're still learning."

As Sarah gathered her papers, her face bright with new understanding, Harlow felt the familiar ache in his chest—the same expression Mei had worn when she finally grasped a difficult concept. This was why he'd become a teacher, why he'd chosen the Academy over the Syndicate's lucrative offers years ago. Moments like these, when a student's eyes lit up with genuine comprehension.

But the world was changing. The Syndicate's influence was spreading like a cancer, their crude methods poisoning the very foundations of thread work. Their recruitment tactics were becoming more aggressive, their "accidents" more frequent. Soon, he might not have the luxury of gentle guidance.

*I won't lose another daughter,* the thought crystallized with brutal clarity. *Not to them. Not ever again.*

After Sarah left, Harlow stood at his window, gazing out at the Academy's moonlit grounds. Somewhere out there, new students were arriving, their gifts untested, their potential unlimited. Among them, if his sources were correct, was Lin Chen's daughter—a girl who might possess the very abilities the Syndicate sought to exploit.

*Lyra Chen.* Even her name felt like an echo of his daughter's—musical, hopeful, carrying the weight of parental dreams. Would she braid flowers in her hair like Mei had? Would she draw pictures for her father? Would she trust the adults around her to keep her safe?

*I won't fail another father the way I failed myself,* he vowed, his reflection ghostlike in the window glass. *I won't let another little girl die because the adults were too slow, too careful, too naive to do what was necessary.*

He would not be too late again. Whatever the cost, whatever methods were required, he would ensure that this generation of thread seers survived to carry the tradition forward. Even if they hated him for it. Even if history remembered him as the villain.

*Better a living enemy than a dead daughter.*

The ozone-jasmine scent of memory clung to him as he returned to his desk, pulling out lesson plans that would need to be... adjusted. The Academy's gentle methods were a luxury he could no longer afford. Not when the Syndicate was recruiting more aggressively, not when students were disappearing from other institutions, not when he could feel the same predatory attention that had once focused on Mei now turning toward this new generation.

He opened his desk drawer, touching Mei's drawing one last time. In the moonlight, the cherry blossoms seemed to glow with their own inner light, and for a moment, he could almost hear her voice: *"I know you're trying to protect them, Daddy. But don't forget to protect yourself too."*

But for tonight, in the quiet of his office, he allowed himself to remember the teacher he'd once hoped to be—before Kyoto taught him that sometimes, to save what you love, you must be willing to destroy it first. Before he learned that the greatest act of love might be to become the thing your children fear most, if it keeps them alive to hate you.

His secure communication device chimed softly. A message from his contact in the medical wing, encrypted and brief: *Thread-burn rising in the Chen girl's father. Neural degradation accelerating. The bridge demands a heartbeat.*

Harlow stared at the words, feeling the familiar weight of impossible choices settling on his shoulders. The bridge between salvation and sacrifice was narrowing. Soon, very soon, he would have to decide which side of that bridge Lyra Chen would stand on.

And whether her father would survive the crossing.
