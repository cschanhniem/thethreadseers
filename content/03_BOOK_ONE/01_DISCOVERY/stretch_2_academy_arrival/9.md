*Weave-Quake Counter: 18% instability (Moderate)*

The train sliced through morning mist, a silver serpent gliding on cool rails, carrying Lyra toward Threadweaver Academy. A knot of hope and trepidation tightened in her stomach, making her breath catch. She desperately sought answers about her mother's disappearance. The silver thread connecting them remained a palpable, unwavering presence, a faint, insistent thrum against her sternum.

"First time to the Academy?"

Lyra turned. A girl her age occupied the seat across the aisle, the fabric of her crimson and silver-piped uniform crisp and new-looking. Her thread signature throbbed with warm amber and deep purple—curiosity and confidence elegantly intertwined, a pleasant hum in the carriage's ambient energies.

"Is it that obvious?" Lyra asked, feeling a flush creep up her neck and warm her cheeks.

The girl smiled, a knowing, almost conspiratorial glint in her eyes. "You have that look—a potent cocktail of excitement and terror. I'm Mei. Third-year resonance specialist."

"Lyra. First-year... everything, I guess."

"Late awakening?" Mei asked, her gaze assessing Lyra's age.

Lyra nodded. "Three weeks ago."

"Unusual. Most manifest by twelve." Mei studied her. Her interest was visibly piqued. "Your modality?"

"Visual, primarily. Light patterns, different colors."

"Multi-spectrum?" Mei's eyebrows arched in surprise. "Rare indeed. Most visual-dominants perceive limited color ranges. The Academy utilizes twelve standard categories for perception, but traditional systems acknowledge far more nuanced variations."

"Does how we see the threads change what they actually are?" Lyra asked, the philosophical question from her father's research papers surfacing unexpectedly.

Mei looked surprised, then thoughtful. "That's... actually a profound question. Western thread science says no—the threads exist objectively, and our perceptions are just different windows onto the same reality. But my grandmother—she's a traditional Chinese silk-seer—she believes our perception and the threads exist in relationship. That by seeing them, we participate in their reality."

"Like quantum physics," Lyra murmured. "The observer effect."

"Precisely. The Academy teaches both perspectives but decidedly favors the Western view in practical applications." Mei's thread signature pulsed with intellectual fervor. "It's a cornerstone philosophical debate in thread theory."

The train curved, unveiling Threadweaver Valley. Lyra gasped. Below, the Academy sprawled—ancient stone and modern glass woven with luminous thread energy. The air crackled, charged and metallic.

"Impressive, isn't it?" Mei said, watching Lyra's reaction. "Wait until you see the Great Loom Chamber."

"The what?"

"The Great Loom Chamber," Mei pointed to the domed central building, "is the Academy's heart, where ley lines converge, and the Council works."

Descending into the valley, the thread patterns intensified. A riot of color and energy. It made Lyra’s vision swim. Feeling the familiar pressure build behind her eyes, a precursor to being overwhelmed, she quickly focused on blue-spectrum threads as Mei had advised. The visual noise dimmed to a more manageable hum. The ache in her temples receded slightly. "Control your perception, or it controls you," Mei said, her voice calm. She gathered her belongings as the train decelerated with a gentle hiss of brakes. "The Academy hosts students from across the globe, with every perception type imaginable. You'll find your place."

Threadweaver Station. A vibrant, bustling hub of converging thread patterns. The air filled with a cacophony of voices, the rumble of unseen machinery beneath the platform. Other students, each distinguished by their unique thread signature, thronged the platform. Their energies, a dizzying, colorful storm.

"Good luck, Lyra," Mei said, joining a group of returning students. "Remember—control your perception."

Alone again, Lyra followed the discreet, elegantly lettered signs toward the Academy shuttle. The scent of ozone and something like damp earth, sharp and clean, clung to the station air. The station itself thrummed with a palpable thread energy, patterns constantly shifting and interweaving as people moved—a visual symphony that threatened to overwhelm her if she let her guard down. She diligently maintained her blue-filter technique, a mental shield against the overwhelming complexity.

A thread-quake warning sign pulsed an urgent amber near the exit. Its light cast fleeting, warm shadows on the cool stone floor. 18% instability. Moderate risk.

"Another one this week," a nearby student muttered. "They're getting more frequent."

Thread-quakes. Lyra had read about them: dimensional instabilities manifesting in the physical world. Minor ones caused headaches for seers; major ones could damage thread structures or even physically harm people. The Academy monitored them constantly via the global Weave-Counter network.

On the shuttle, Lyra cautiously expanded her perception. The valley throbbed with connections: ley lines like silver rivers, intricate energetic networks, and countless personal threads. And a subtle silver shimmer, achingly familiar, so like her mother's thread, permeated everything.

Lyra's heart quickened. The jade pendant warmed against her skin as the silver thread within her chest pulsed, resonating with the valley's energy. Whatever had happened to her mother was undeniably connected to this place—to the silver threads seemingly woven into the Academy's very foundation.

"I'll find you," she whispered, her promise carried away by the mountain wind. "Whatever it takes."

Cresting a hill, Threadweaver Academy unfurled before her—a striking convergence of ancient and modern traditions. Her new home. And, she felt with a chilling certainty, the epicenter of her mother's disappearance.

The silver thread within her chest pulsed once more—a silent tremor. Acknowledgment? Encouragement? Warning? Lyra couldn't decipher it. But as the shuttle approached the imposing Academy gates, she knew crossing that threshold would irrevocably alter her life.

At the security checkpoint, a uniformed guard with a severe, light-devouring crimson-black thread signature meticulously examined vehicles. "Security Chief Blackwood," Mei whispered, her voice hushed. "Runs security like a fortress. Best avoided."

The security chief's gaze swept over the shuttle, her thread signature probing each passenger with unnerving, clinical precision. When her eyes met Lyra's, a flicker of unexpected focus—recognition, perhaps, or a pointed, assessing interest—was instantly veiled.

"Papers out," the driver called. "New students have your acceptance letters ready."

As Lyra fumbled in her bag for her documents, the rough canvas of the bag scraping against her knuckles, a folded paper slipped from between the pages of her sketchbook. She didn't recognize it: thin, almost translucent rice paper covered in elegant Chinese calligraphy, the ink a deep, rich black, with an official-looking seal impressed in crimson at the bottom.

"What's this?" she murmured, unfolding it carefully.

Mei glanced over, then inhaled sharply. "That's Security Chief Blackwood's personal stationery. Where did you get that?"

"I didn't," Lyra said, confused. "It was just... here."

The letter was written in classical Chinese, the characters flowing with practiced precision:

*Board Members,*

*The Academy's approach to thread knowledge remains fundamentally flawed. Their "preservation" is merely appropriation under academic guise. What was taken from my family—from countless traditional practitioners—cannot be recovered through institutional channels.*

*The Syndicate's extraction methodology offers a more direct solution. When knowledge is hoarded by institutions, it must be reclaimed by any means necessary. The Magnus Conduit project progresses despite Council resistance. Our asset is now fully embedded and reports significant advancement in thread harvesting techniques.*

*The Chen girl's arrival presents both opportunity and risk. Her thread signature shows remarkable similarity to her mother's—multi-spectrum perception with silver resonance. Monitoring protocols are in place. If she manifests Animus Argenti affinity, extraction priority elevates to Alpha.*

*Knowledge is power only when controlled. The Academy "preserves" but does not protect. We will do both.*

*—M.B.*

Lyra's blood ran cold. A chill seeped deep into her bones, making her shiver despite the shuttle's warmth. Her hands trembled so violently she could barely refold the delicate rice paper, its texture surprisingly smooth, almost slick, beneath her shaking fingertips. *Extraction. Thread harvesting. Animus Argenti affinity. Extraction priority Alpha.* Each phrase was a hammer blow against her composure. The clinical, predatory language assaulted her, leaving her breathless, lungs constricting. This wasn't mere philosophical disagreement. This was a direct, terrifying threat aimed at her, at her mother's legacy. The "asset fully embedded" performing "thread harvesting"—a chilling echo of Nai Nai's warning about "thread thieves." The words tasted like ash and bile on her tongue. Could this be linked to the student collapses Dayo had described? Nausea roiled in her stomach, hot and acidic, making her swallow hard. This letter wasn't misplaced. It was a horrifying glimpse into a shadowy, dangerous underworld festering beneath the Academy's serene facade.

The letter's language revealed a fundamental, brutal conflict—not just about thread knowledge, but about who had the right to access it, how it should be shared, and the attendant responsibilities. The Academy's institutional "preservation" versus this "Syndicate's" direct, ruthless "extraction." Both claimed to protect knowledge, but with profoundly different, and apparently violent, methods.

It echoed the epigraph she'd read about perception—how different ways of seeing might not just be different windows onto the same reality, but might co-create different realities. Perhaps these competing approaches to thread knowledge weren't merely political or practical disagreements, but fundamentally different ways of understanding reality itself.

And somehow, her mother—and now Lyra herself—stood at the center of this philosophical battle.

"You should destroy that," Mei whispered, her voice tight with genuine fear, her eyes wide as she glanced towards the front of the shuttle. "Burn it. Now. If Blackwood even *suspects* you've seen that…" Mei didn't finish, but the terror in her threads was eloquent enough.

But it was too late. The rhythmic, unhurried tap of the security chief's boots on the shuttle floor grew closer. Each step, a beat of impending doom. It resonated through the floorboards, into Lyra's own feet. Her crimson-black thread signature pulsed with a controlled, predatory intent. It seemed to leech the light and warmth from the air, making Lyra’s skin crawl, the hairs on her arms stand on end. Lyra’s heart hammered against her ribs. A frantic drum against the sudden, oppressive silence that fell over the shuttle. With fumbling, clumsy fingers, she slipped the letter back into her sketchbook. The paper crinkled. A sound that seemed deafening in her own ears. She prayed it looked undisturbed. Just as Blackwood boarded. Her very presence immediately dampened the ambient thread energy within the vehicle. Like a sudden drop in barometric pressure. It made Lyra’s ears pop. The air felt heavy, difficult to breathe.

"Identification," she said crisply, extending her hand toward Lyra. "New student?"

"Yes," Lyra managed, handing over her acceptance letter. "Lyra Chen."

Something flickered in Blackwood's eyes—recognition, calculation, interest. "Chen. Any relation to Professor Lin Chen?"

"My mother," Lyra replied, heart pounding.

"Interesting." Blackwood’s gaze lingered. A moment longer than strictly necessary. Her thread signature subtly, invasively probed Lyra's own. "Welcome to Threadweaver Academy, Ms. Chen. I trust you'll find it... illuminating."
As she spoke, her left hand unconsciously touched a small silk charm at her wrist—a delicate thing of twilight hues that seemed to pulse with its own subtle warmth, distinct from her cold thread signature.

She returned the acceptance letter and moved on, but Lyra felt the chilling weight of her attention clinging to her like a shroud. The intercepted letter burned in her sketchbook like a live coal, its implications too vast and disturbing to fully process.

As the shuttle finally passed through the gates, Lyra's certainty that crossing this threshold would change her life had taken on a darker edge. The Academy held answers about her mother—but also, it seemed, dangers she hadn't anticipated.

The philosophical questions from the epigraph now felt urgently personal. If perception shapes reality, then what reality was she entering? Whose perception would define her experience here—the Academy's institutional framework, her family's traditional understanding, or something new she would discover for herself? And if knowledge itself was contested territory, what responsibility did she bear for how she used what she learned?

These weren't abstract questions anymore. They were the terrain she would have to navigate to find her mother and understand her own emerging abilities. The threads that connected all things also connected these philosophical dilemmas to her personal quest.

She was ready. She had to be.

## THE KYOTO LECTURE

*Three days later - Lumina Lecture Hall*

The Lumina Lecture Hall felt different. Usually, it thrummed with comforting latent thread energy. Today, it was stretched taut, vibrating with a sharper, expectant frequency—an almost inaudible hum that resonated in Lyra's teeth like a plucked string. Professor Armitage, his usual ebullience noticeably subdued, introduced Dr. Alistair Harlow, a renowned specialist in "Theoretical Thread Dynamics and Historical Animus Signatures." Lyra sketched—not Harlow, but the way dust motes danced in the light gilding the ancient, scarred lectern, an anchor in Threadweaver's overwhelming strangeness.

"Dr. Harlow's work in Kyoto," Armitage announced, his voice amplified by the hall, each syllable distinct. "His groundbreaking research into pre-Collapse animus concentrations, has been… transformative." A faint hesitation. A catch in his breath. Lyra's charcoal froze.

Harlow advanced. The subtle swish of his dark, impeccably tailored suit was a counterpoint to the hall's expectant silence. No smile thawed his severe features. His winter-sky eyes, cool and incisive as a surgeon's scalpel, scanned the students. He lingered, perhaps a fraction too long, on each. A prickle, like cold spider-silk, danced along Lyra's neck. A primal urge: shrink, become invisible. She hunched harder over her sketch, the graphite whispering like secrets as a griffin's wing unfurled.

He commenced. His precise voice, imbued with an intensity that seemed to charge the air, dropped each word like a carefully polished stone into the hall's expectant hush. Threads, he posited, were not Lyra's living Weave but quantifiable forces to be mastered. He spoke of 'entropic decay,' 'animus potential optimization'—alien lexicons to Lyra. For her, the Weave was symphony, an ecosystem alive with warmth and color. The cadence of his voice, more than his unsettling theories, snagged something deep within her—a tightening in her chest, a sudden stillness in her own breath. It was *him*. His sheer intensity radiated, an almost physical pressure in the room. And then, an elusive fragrance, sharp and clean undercutting the hall's mustiness: ozone, and sweet, distant jasmine tea.

A memory surfaced, unbidden, ephemeral as a dream: sunlight fractured by shoji screens; the loamy scent of matcha; a kind, melancholic-eyed man in a tranquil Kyoto teahouse. Older, perhaps, than the figure on stage, yet his eyes harbored that same unsettling depth, that weary, ancient wisdom she now perceived in Professor Harlow. This childhood phantom had spoken softly of the world listening back, of whispers ensconced in old stones and patient trees. He'd regarded her childish sketches not with polite dismissal but with a quiet, knowing sorrow that resonated with her own sensitivity—a shared glance that made her feel, for one startling moment, profoundly understood. The hazy recollection offered no clear visage, only the indelible impression of shared secrets, the warmth of being truly *seen* for the first time—both comforting and terrifying.

Now, as Professor Harlow vivisected the Weave into cold equations, a jarring dissonance resonated within Lyra, as if a beautiful melody had been abruptly twisted into a discordant shriek. The man on stage seemed a universe removed from that gentle stranger, yet Harlow's gaze held a similar penetrating insight. The scent of ozone and jasmine, more pungent now, bridged the years like an invisible, charged wire. Could it be? The notion was preposterous: Professor Harlow, formidable, almost predatory, and the quiet, contemplative man from a half-forgotten Kyoto afternoon? Lyra banished the thought. Her fingers tightened on her charcoal as she focused fiercely on her griffin sketch, adding protective strokes to its pinions. A trick of the mind, surely. Stress. The disquieting lecture. Yet the echo persisted, a troubling counterpoint beneath his words, making her skin crawl, the fine hairs on her arms standing on end like tiny sentinels. This Professor Harlow felt… familiar. And that familiarity, more than his chilling pronouncements, sent a shiver down her spine. An inexplicable compulsion surged through her: conceal her pendant, shield its delicate silver thread from his too-knowing, dissecting gaze.

A faint, subliminal aroma drifted from the stage: sharp ozone, mingled with ghostly sweet jasmine. Lyra tilted her head, frowning. Strange. Unsettling. Compelling. She imbued her griffin's eye with a dark, swirling shadow, capturing her disquiet.

Milo and Kael remained riveted, their notebooks filling with rapid script, pens scratching like diligent insects. Lyra drifted. Her own sketchbook lay forgotten. A knot tightened in her stomach as a sense of wrongness burgeoned. Harlow's theories felt like dismembering a butterfly, pinning its iridescent wings to a board, cataloging its beauty while missing its poetry, its very essence.

Then the lecture took an unexpected turn. Harlow's clinical demeanor shifted, his voice dropping to something more personal, more urgent. "Sometimes," he said, his fingers tracing the air where invisible threads might flow, "we face scenarios where protective severance becomes necessary."

His voice caught, almost imperceptibly, on the word 'severance.' For a moment, his clinical mask slipped, revealing something broken underneath—a father's desperate love twisted into something sharp and cutting.

"Consider," his voice grew softer, more dangerous, "a young thread seer whose natural abilities make her a target. Whose very existence draws predators who would use her gifts to harm others." His gaze swept the room, but Lyra felt it linger on her with uncomfortable intensity. "In such cases, when one person's pain might destroy an entire network, we must make... difficult calculations."

The word 'calculations' seemed to tear something inside him. His winter-sky eyes found Lyra's across the hall, and for a heartbeat, she saw not the cold professor but a father's anguish wrapped in academic language.

"Sometimes, to save what you love," he continued, his voice barely above a whisper, "you must be willing to cut it free. Even if it means they'll never understand. Even if it means they'll hate you for the very protection you offer."

The words hung in the air like a confession disguised as theory. Several students shifted uncomfortably, sensing the personal weight behind his clinical tone, but unable to grasp its true meaning. Only Lyra seemed to hear the echo of a father's lament in his carefully controlled voice.

The lecture concluded. Behind Harlow, a stark diagram of thread intersections materialized—a machine schematic. His voice dropped, a conspiratorial whisper that carried to every corner of the hushed hall. "The potential to mitigate large-scale emotional cascades, to stabilize societal resonance, is within our grasp. If we possess the courage to understand, and act upon, the fundamental mechanics of the Weave."

He paused, his gaze sweeping the room with clinical precision. "Of course, such interventions require difficult calculations. In any large-scale stabilization, we must accept that some individual thread patterns may be... disrupted. The mathematics are clear: if we can prevent societal collapse affecting millions, an acceptable attrition rate of perhaps two to three percent becomes not just justifiable, but morally imperative."

The casual way he spoke of human cost—as if lives were merely variables in an equation—sent a chill through the hall. Several students shifted uncomfortably, but Harlow continued with the same measured tone one might use to discuss weather patterns.

A beat of silence. Then, the Q&A commenced. Hands erupted across the hall. Harlow, with unnerving precision, deflected questions back onto students. He probed their assumptions, dissected their reasoning. Lyra remained silent, observing. Until Kael nudged her.

"Go on, Lyra," he urged in a low whisper. "That thing you were saying earlier, about the… the 'feel' of different threads? Ask him."

Lyra wavered. Her observations felt nebulous, deeply personal. Rooted in senses others didn't share. But Harlow's gaze snared hers. An unreadable flicker in their icy depths. As if he divined her unspoken query.

She drew a shallow breath. Raised her hand.

"Dr. Harlow," her voice emerged clearer, steadier than she'd anticipated. "You speak of threads as quantifiable, as energy systems. But some of us perceive them with more… sensory nuance. Different emotions, different connections—they seem to possess distinct textures, colors, even sounds. How does your framework accommodate this qualitative, experiential dimension of the Weave?"

A hush descended. So profound Lyra imagined she could hear the faint thrum of the Academy's ancient wards. Harlow's eyes locked onto her, sharp and unwavering as obsidian points. Lyra felt exposed. A raw nerve. As if he could perceive her nascent threads, her silver pendant thrumming faintly—a tiny, captured heartbeat beneath her uniform. The scent of ozone and jasmine intensified, prickling her senses, almost acrid.

But beneath his clinical stare, Lyra glimpsed something else—a flicker of pain so profound it made her breath catch. For just a moment, she saw not the cold professor but someone who had lost everything, someone whose love had been twisted into something sharp and protective and terrible. The recognition hit her like a physical blow: he wasn't teaching theory. He was reliving trauma.

"An astute question, Miss…?" His voice was a soft rasp.

"Lyra," she supplied, heat flooding her cheeks. "Lyra Wei."

"Miss Wei." He inclined his head, a gesture more analytical than curious, like a hawk considering its quarry. "Your 'experiential dimension' is indeed fascinating. Raw data, one might venture. The challenge, of course, resides in translating such subjective perception into objective, verifiable metrics. The Weave, Miss Wei, is not an untamed mystery to be passively experienced; it is a fundamental force, a complex system of energies. And like any system, its threads yield to will—disciplined, focused, informed will. Do these 'textures' and 'colors' you perceive fluctuate in intensity? Do certain artifacts, or perhaps individuals, amplify them for you, make them sing, as it were?"

For the briefest moment—a flicker so quick it might have been imagined—something shifted in his winter-sky eyes. Recognition? Memory? The phantom scent of matcha and the echo of a child's voice speaking of lonely trees seemed to whisper through his consciousness. *A library of wishes.* But the moment passed, buried beneath years of calculated control.

His gaze, sharp as glacial ice, flickered—a nanosecond, a spark in the cold depths—directed to where her pendant lay concealed. Lyra's hand flew to her chest, the fabric of her uniform suddenly rough against her palm.

*How could he possibly know?*

"I… I'm still learning," she stammered, her voice a threadbare whisper, nearly lost in the vastness of the hall. "But yes. Some old objects… resonate more loudly, a deeper hum. Some people's threads are brighter, more vibrant. Almost painfully so."

Harlow's expression remained inscrutable. Yet a keen, almost predatory gleam ignited in the depths of his eyes, like embers flaring in a winter hearth. "Fascinating." His voice was soft, almost a purr, sending a fresh shiver down Lyra's spine. "Does the Academy curriculum encourage the systematic documentation of such… anomalies?" He didn't await her answer, his attention broadening, sweeping the room like a searchlight. "Indeed. This Academy's very architecture, its ancient stones, its carefully curated relics—all constitute a vast, interconnected energetic system. Its sensitivities, its vulnerabilities, remain largely unmapped."

He advanced to the stage's edge, his gaze raking the room, seeming to pierce the very walls, to see the hidden currents flowing like unseen rivers beneath. "Consider the ambient animus fields within these halls. Stable? Uniform? Or are there pockets of unusual intensity? Resonances indicative of… *untapped potential*?"

His words hung. Charged. Electric. Each syllable crackled with unseen energy. Lyra felt an abrupt chill snake down her spine despite the hall's warmth. His gaze swept the room again. It was no longer the look of a lecturer. It was the focused intent of a Seer actively testing, probing the very air around them with his will.

A faint shimmer—like heat haze undulating from summer asphalt, or the distortion above a flame—flickered for a heartbeat. It danced around the massive, rune-etched keystone above the main archway. No one else appeared to notice, their attention fixed on Harlow. Lyra's breath hitched. A tiny gasp caught in her throat. *Had he done that? With just his mind?*

Beside her, Milo winced suddenly, pressing a hand to his ear. "Anyone else hear that?" he whispered. "High-pitched whine, like... eight kilohertz?" But the others shook their heads, focused on Harlow's demonstration. 🔗

The lecture officially concluded. Harlow lingered. He fielded a few more questions, his focus ostensibly on the eager students congregating around him. Yet Lyra felt his awareness like a palpable weight, a subtle pressure on her senses. Students began to disperse, their voices a low susurrus. Harlow descended from the stage. His movements possessed a quiet, fluid grace that seemed incongruous with his severe, almost ascetic demeanor.

Professor Armitage was engrossed in conversation, his nervous laughter echoing a little too loudly in the emptying hall. Harlow's path, however, angled subtly, inexorably, toward Lyra, Milo, and Kael as they navigated toward the exit. Lyra feigned nonchalance she was far from feeling. Her breath caught; her heart hammered a frantic, muffled drum against her ribs.

"A most stimulating discussion, Dr. Harlow," Armitage effused. His tone was overly eager, almost fawning.

"The young minds here are… receptive," Harlow murmured. The sound barely stirred the air. Then, he materialized before them. The scent of ozone and jasmine preceded him like an invisible, chilling wave.

He paused. An afterthought, perhaps, as Lyra moved to pass. The cool air of his passage brushed her cheek. "Miss Wei." His voice, soft as falling snow yet honed like a razor, made the hairs on her arms bristle. Ozone and jasmine. Overwhelmingly potent. Stealing the air from her lungs.

Lyra froze. Her boots seemed to stick to the polished stone floor. Close up, a faint, silvery cicatrix, like a frozen lightning crack, traced a jagged line from his left temple into his hairline.

"Your observations on qualitative thread perception," he continued. Cool eyes imprisoned hers. The pressure of his stare was almost a physical weight. "Insightful for a first-year. Keep meticulous notes. Some sensitivities are rarer. More… valuable."

His gaze plunged again. Briefly. Pointedly. To her hidden pendant—a tangible touch. Then, turning slightly, as if to address Kael, his hand—cool, dry—brushed her arm. A touch so light. So ostensibly accidental.

It was not.

Not a mere touch. A conflagration.

Searing, silver fire—an icy inferno—blazed up Lyra's arm. A blinding flash. A silent, violent crackle erupted in her mind, like a live wire snapping, short-circuiting thought. It was the exact sensation of her pendant when her emotions churned, when threads agitated, but amplified a hundredfold, intensified, as if his touch completed a hidden, volatile circuit. She gasped, a choked sound, and stumbled back, her balance lost. Her eyes were wide with shock and burgeoning terror, the afterimage of that silver fire burning like a brand behind her eyelids.

Harlow's eyes met hers. Pupils like pinpricks in the glacial depths. No mistaking the flicker.

Not surprise. Not apology.

*Confirmation*.

The cool, detached interest of a scientist observing a potent, predicted reaction. A fleeting phantom of a smile, thin as a razor's edge, touched his lips. Vanished instantly, like smoke.

"Apologies, Miss Wei," he murmured. His voice was smooth as polished obsidian, devoid of any warmth. The ozone-jasmine scent, now laced with something faintly metallic, sharp and unsettling as blood, clung to him like a miasma. "Clumsy of me."

A curt, dismissive nod. He proceeded towards the exit with Armitage.

Lyra stared after him. Her arm tingled with a phantom burn that felt etched into her very bones. Her thoughts scattered like leaves in a storm, struggling to reassemble into any coherent pattern.

Milo and Kael regarded her. Their faces were etched with apprehension. Kael's brow furrowed. Milo's mouth was slightly agape.

"Lyra? You alright?" Milo asked. His hand hovered near her elbow, poised to steady her. "You look like you've seen a wraith."

"Or touched one," Kael appended. His eyes narrowed, fixed on Harlow's retreating silhouette—a dark shape disappearing into the corridor's gloom. "What in the Weave was *that*?"

Lyra couldn't articulate an answer. Her throat was tight.

She could only feel the phantom burn on her arm, a lingering echo of silver fire.

And a chilling, unshakeable certainty crystallizing in her gut: Dr. Alistair Harlow was far more than a mere guest lecturer.

He had discerned something in her. Sensed something from her. Recognized something within her.

His look, the silver fire his touch had ignited—this was not mere academic curiosity.

It was something colder. Sharper.

Infinitely more perilous.

The Academy's ancient stones, always thrumming with comfort and history, now seemed to resonate with a different timbre: a silent, urgent admonition.

As they left the lecture hall, Lyra's secure communication device—a standard Academy-issued tablet—chimed with an urgent medical alert. The message was brief, clinical, terrifying: *Emergency notification: Wei Chen, Room 247, Westbrook Neurological Institute. Vital signs critical. Neural activity flatlined at 15:47. Immediate family contact required.*

The device slipped from her numb fingers, clattering on the ancient stones. The sound echoed through the corridor like a death knell.

Her father's heartbeat had stopped.
