# Chapter 17B: The Trigger

*Professor Harlow's Laboratory - 11:47 PM*

Marcus Harlow stood before the Thread-Maze monitoring station, watching real-time stability readings flicker across multiple screens. The Academy slept around him, but sleep was a luxury he'd abandoned years ago. The silver scars on his wrists pulsed with dull ache—they always did when he was about to cross another line.

*Weave-Quake Counter: 23% instability (Moderate - Accelerating)*

The numbers climbed steadily, just as his calculations had predicted. The Chen girl's uncontrolled resonance was destabilizing the local thread matrix faster than anticipated. Soon, the Academy's protective barriers would fail, and the cascade would begin. Unless he acted.

His fingers hovered over the activation sequence for the Thread-Maze emergency protocol. One command, and the maze would shift into crisis mode—forcing the students inside to confront their deepest fears while he harvested the raw emotional energy their terror would generate. Enough power to stabilize the local Weave for months.

*Enough power to test the Magnus Conduit.*

The photo on his desk caught the monitor's glow—Aiko and Mei under cherry blossoms, their faces bright with laughter he could no longer remember hearing. They were still alive in Kyoto, still breathing, still existing. But to them, he was nothing. A stranger. A ghost of a man who had never been part of their lives.

*"The threads respond to intention,"* Lin Chen had written in her journal, the one he'd studied obsessively after her disappearance. *"They are not just connections—they are pathways."*

Pathways. Yes. But pathways could be redirected, rerouted, controlled. Lin had believed in communion with the Weave, in gentle guidance and patient cultivation. She had been wrong. The Weave was not a garden to be tended—it was a river to be dammed, channeled, harnessed for the greater good.

His hand moved to the activation key.

*"Papa, look! It's dancing!"* Mei's voice, four years old and full of wonder, echoing across fifteen years of silence.

The memory struck him like a physical blow. For a moment, his resolve wavered. These were children in the maze. Frightened, vulnerable children who trusted the Academy to protect them.

But children died when the Weave collapsed. He'd seen it in Kyoto—the dimensional fractures that had torn through the research facility, severing not just threads but lives. The screams that had echoed through the cherry blossoms as reality itself came undone.

*Better a living enemy than a dead daughter.*

His finger pressed the key.

Across the Academy, alarms began to sound. In the Thread-Maze, walls shifted and passages rearranged themselves into configurations designed to maximize psychological pressure. The students inside—including Lyra Chen and her precious quartet—would face their worst nightmares made manifest.

And from their terror, he would harvest the power needed to save them all.

The monitors showed their vital signs spiking as the maze began its work. Fear-threads blazed to life, raw and potent. The energy collectors hummed as they began to draw in the emotional resonance, converting terror into stabilizing force.

*Forgive me,* he thought, watching Lyra's biometric readings spike as she encountered whatever horror the maze had conjured for her. *But some prices must be paid.*

The Magnus Conduit prototype in the corner of his lab began to glow, its crystalline matrix drinking in the harvested energy. Soon, he would have enough power to test his theories. Soon, he would know if the threads that bound him to Aiko and Mei could be restored.

And if they could, then every choice he'd made—every line he'd crossed, every child he'd terrified, every principle he'd abandoned—would be justified.

The screens showed the maze's efficiency ratings climbing. Optimal terror response achieved. Energy collection at 87% capacity.

Marcus Harlow watched his students suffer, and told himself it was for the greater good.

In the photo on his desk, Aiko and Mei smiled at a man they no longer remembered, in a world that no longer existed.

But perhaps, with enough power, enough control, enough willingness to pay any price—that world could exist again.

The maze continued its work. The children continued to scream.

And Marcus Harlow continued to harvest their pain, one thread at a time.
