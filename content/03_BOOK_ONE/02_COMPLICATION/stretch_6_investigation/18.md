## THE MIDNIGHT DISCOVERY

*Three floors above Blackwood's office...*

Lyra pressed herself against the cold stone wall, her heart hammering as footsteps echoed in the corridor below. She'd been following the strange energy signatures that had been plaguing her dreams—threads of silver and crimson that pulsed with wrongness. Her Animus Argenti pendant grew cold against her skin, warning her of danger she couldn't yet comprehend.

*In the East Wing office...*

Security Chief Blackwood waited as Professor Harlow entered, his silver scars pulsing with dull pain. "You're late," she said without looking up from her tablet.

"Council meeting ran long," Harlow replied, injecting raw thread energy into his scarred forearm. "Weaver's growing suspicious."

*Above, Lyra crept closer to the ventilation grate, catching fragments: "...thread-burn..." "...Syndicate resources..." "...proof of concept..."*

## THE BARGAIN

Harlow's hand trembled as he injected raw thread energy into his scarred forearm. The violent trembling subsided, but the gnawing hunger of thread-burn remained.

"The Magnus Conduit requires proof of concept," Blackwood said, displaying a stark graph on her tablet. "You're at sixty-seven percent thread-burn, Marcus. The Syndicate wants a demonstration."

"A test subject," Harlow whispered, understanding immediately.

"Lines are luxuries for those who haven't lost what you have," Blackwood replied, producing a worn photograph—Aiko and Mei, his wife and daughter, their faces bright with laughter.

Harlow's breath caught. "How did you—"

"Mei is fifteen now. She's beginning to show signs of thread sensitivity, but without proper guidance, she's confused. Frightened." Blackwood slid a data crystal across the desk. "The Syndicate can facilitate a reunion. Memory thread restoration. But only after you prove the Conduit works."

## THE TARGET

Harlow stared at the crystal, the terrible weight of choice pressing down on him. His mind supplied the name before Blackwood spoke it.

"The Chen girl," Blackwood suggested, her voice soft yet devastating. "Lyra. Her unique resonance with the Animus Argenti makes her ideal."

"Lyra Chen is Lin's daughter," Harlow objected weakly. "Lin and I were colleagues, friends once..."

"And Lyra Chen is the price of getting your own daughter back," Blackwood finished coldly. "One girl's temporary discomfort against your family's restoration."

*Above, Lyra's blood ran cold as she heard her name. Her thread-sight flared, revealing the dark alliance forming below.*

## THE AGREEMENT

The silver scars on Harlow's arm pulsed as fifteen years of grief crushed his remaining resistance. The man he had once been would have rejected this proposal without hesitation. That man was gone now, burned away by desperate hope.

"I'll need discreet access to her thread signature," he said finally, the words tasting like ash.

"The upcoming Thread Maze practical exam provides the perfect opportunity," Blackwood replied with cold satisfaction.

She extended her hand across the desk. "Do we have an agreement, Professor?"

Harlow hesitated for a single heartbeat, clutching the photograph of Aiko and Mei. Everything he'd sacrificed for fifteen years culminated in this monstrous choice.

"We have an agreement," he whispered, taking her hand.

Their thread signatures intertwined briefly—his damaged and desperate, hers cold and calculating. An unholy alliance sealed.

## THE ESCAPE

*Above, Lyra pressed herself against the wall, her heart pounding. She had to warn the others. She had to stop this.*

*But first, she had to escape without being detected.*

Footsteps echoed in the corridor below—Harlow leaving Blackwood's office. Lyra held her breath, counting the seconds until the sound faded. The click of the door echoed with chilling finality. The Chen girl would be his test subject. Her energy would prove the Magnus Conduit's viability. And with the Syndicate's resources, he would finally restore what Kyoto had taken from him.

*Three floors above, Lyra began her careful retreat through the Academy's shadows, her Animus Argenti pendant cold against her skin—a constant reminder that she was now the hunted, carrying the terrible knowledge of what was to come.*
