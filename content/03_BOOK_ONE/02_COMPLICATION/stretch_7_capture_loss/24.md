Darkness. Not night's gentle texture, nor the mind's landscape behind closed eyes. This was *absence*—a void where the vibrant, threaded world had once danced before her eyes.

Alone in her dorm room, the space felt alien, bare. The window, once a kaleidoscope of sun-fractured thread patterns (线纹 - xiàn wén), was now a flat, dull rectangle of light. Walls, once alive with emotional echoes and the building’s structural threads (结构线 - jié gòu xiàn), stood inert.

Her hands trembled as she reached for charcoal and sketchbook. The familiar weight, the paper's texture, creation's ritual—her refuge. But draw what? How could she create when the most beautiful patterns were stripped from her sight?

*I am more than my threads,* she told herself, echoing words to Harlow. *I see them—hear them, feel them. Witness, not just sight.*

Hollow words against such loss. Thread-sight wasn't just an ability; it was her world, her connection, her meaning in chaos. Without it, she felt not just blind, but diminished. Less.

The silver thread—her mother's—her constant guide, her intimate link to the woman lost too young for memory. Now, even that gone. Or was it?

Closing her eyes, focusing inward, Lyra sensed something. A warmth in her chest, pulsing gently. Not visible, but *felt*. A presence, a resonance, a whisper of connection beyond sight.

The Silver Soul. Still there. A warmth in her chest, no longer vision observed but essence embodied.

Hesitantly, charcoal met paper. No plan, no visual guide. Her hand moved, led by inner warmth, by memory-echoes of connection.

Charcoal scratched, random and disconnected—an artist unmoored. Gradually, a pattern emerged—not the old vibrant tapestry, but something primal. She sketched her room's negative space, the shadows where threads had once flowed. The window, a dark portal; walls, permeable membranes veined with emptiness.

At the center, a small figure—herself—defined by surrounding darkness, a silhouette of absence. Yet, from its chest, a single silver-white line: the Silver Soul, no longer seen but felt, lived.

Drawing, something shifted. Panic loosened its grip. In its place: not acceptance, but determination. A recognition of another way to perceive, connect, understand.

Charcoal moved faster, more confident. Shadows on the page deepened, gained texture. The silver line from her chest branched, reaching like roots for water. Not the intricate threads once seen, but something more fundamental: the skeleton of connection, relationship's bare architecture.

A knock startled her. Charcoal snapped, a jagged mark on the drawing.

"Lyra?" Milo's voice, muffled. "In there? We've been looking everywhere."

She stared at the broken charcoal, at the unconscious drawing—disturbing, new, yet holding a truth she was only grasping.

"Coming," she called, voice surprisingly steady.

Rising, her foot caught. As she stumbled, her hand brushed a smooth object on her desk: Nai Nai’s forgotten jade pendant.

Skin met jade. A tactile jolt, a vibration (振动 - zhèn dòng), resonated through her. The stone hummed recognition. She *felt* threads connecting it to Nai Nai, her mother, and herself—a lineage of perception the Academy had never valued. The pendant warmed her palm, pulsing with the silver warmth in her chest. Connection.

"I'm coming," she repeated, slipping the pendant over her head. Its familiar weight against her sternum: a circuit completing, an anchor.

She glanced at the drawing: shadow-threads, a void-self, a silver lifeline. Premonition? Warning? Or a map through the coming darkness?

Either way, she wouldn't face it alone. The silver thread—felt, not seen—would lead her friends. Together, they would find a way, even through shadows.

"We were worried," Milo said, eyes scanning her face. "After Harlow... the Council's in emergency session. They say you lost your thread-sight."

Lyra nodded, hand unconsciously at the jade pendant. "I can't see them," she confirmed. "But I don't think they're gone."

Milo frowned. "What do you mean?"

She reached for his hand. Skin touched. She felt it—a subtle pulse, different from sight but unmistakable. His resonator threads, once harmonious blue-green patterns, were now a gentle vibration against her palm.

The sensation was unlike anything she had experienced before—not the bright, visual threads she had once seen, but something more intimate. Milo's threads felt like the gentle vibration of a tuning fork held against her skin, speaking of his steady, loyal nature.

"I feel your threads," she said, wonder in her voice. "Not see them... feel them. Like music felt through the skin, not heard by the ears."

Milo's eyes widened. "Touch-based thread perception. It's rare, but some traditions describe it—usually after trauma forces the mind to find new pathways."

"My senses are… remapping," Lyra struggled to explain. "Finding different pathways. The threads were never *just* visual, were they? Always deeper."

She led him to the drawing. "Drew this before you knocked. Before I understood. Look at the negative spaces, the shadows where I saw threads."

Milo studied it, his resonators perceiving its deeper layers. "Remarkable. You've captured thread essence without depicting threads. Like drawing space between stars to show constellations."

"The Silver Soul is still with me," Lyra said, touching her chest where silver warmth pulsed. "My mother's thread. Guiding me to a different perception."

"The Council needs to know," Milo said. "Changes everything about thread-sight loss. Harlow hadn't destroyed your connection; he'd forced its transformation."

Lyra nodded, hesitating. "Before the Council... I need to try something. Something Nai Nai taught me, before I knew what threads were."

From her desk, she took a small wooden box inlaid with mother-of-pearl. Inside, spools of colored silk thread—physical thread.

"An old Chinese tradition," she explained, selecting silver silk. "Grandmother said our ancestors communicated with the thread dimension this way, before formal training. Physical knots that echo the patterns of the Weave."

Her practiced fingers tied intricate knots, each with deliberate intention. Eyes closed, she focused on the silk's feel, tension of each knot, the pattern forming.

"What are you doing?" Milo watched, fascinated.

"Creating a physical anchor for thread perception," Lyra replied, eyes closed. "Knots create resonance patterns that... there."

Final knot tied, she held the silk. To Milo's sight, the silk glowed with subtle energy, a physical thread mirroring Weave patterns.

"I feel it," Lyra whispered, awed. "The connection. The Weave responding." She opened her eyes, meeting Milo's with new confidence. "I'm not thread-blind. I'm thread-changed."

She stood, pocketing knotted silk and jade pendant. "Now, the Council. I have something to show them about threads they might not understand."

Leaving the dorm, Lyra’s steps were steady, posture straight. Losing thread-sight hadn't diminished her; it had transformed her, pushing her toward a deeper understanding of the Weave and her place within it.

The threads remained. She was learning a new dance with them.
