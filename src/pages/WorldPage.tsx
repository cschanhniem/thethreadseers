            </h3>
            <p>
              The Thread Dimension exists as a parallel reality overlapping our physical world, where
              connections between all living things manifest as luminous strands of energy. These threads
              carry emotions, memories, and the essence of relationships themselves. The collective network
              of all threads is known as the Weave—a vast, living ecosystem that shows signs of developing
              its own consciousness.

              Thread Types
            </h3>
            <p>
              Threads appear in different colors and textures based on their nature: silver for family bonds,
              gold for friendship, deep blue for knowledge, emerald for connections to nature, and ruby-red
              for conflict. The rare Animus Argenti—pure silver threads of consciousness—represent the
              living core of the dimension itself.

              Rare individuals born with the ability to perceive the Thread Dimension. Most Thread Seers
              fall into categories: Visualizers who see threads clearly, Resonators who hear them as music,
              Empaths who feel their emotional content, Navigators who can trace them across distances,
              and the rarest Manipulators who can alter the threads themselves. Some develop evolved
              perceptions like Tactile Communion—experiencing threads through touch and full-body sensation.

              The Hidden School
            </h3>
            <p>
              Founded in 1798 in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts, Threadweaver Academy serves
              as North America's oldest Thread Seer institution. Hidden within the prestigious Westbrook
              Academy, it appears as an ordinary boarding school to non-seers, but reveals its true nature
              to those with Thread Sight through perception filters and architectural impossibilities.

              The Academy's central chamber houses the Great Loom—a vast domed hall where historical
              threads are preserved in living marble columns. This sacred space serves as both library
              and living record of the collective actions and consequences within the Academy's history,
              embodying the karmic traces of generations of Thread Seers.

              Cultural Traditions

            <p>
              The Academy integrates thread traditions from around the world: Korean geometric patterns,
              Indian philosophical approaches, Egyptian hieroglyphic systems, African pattern-speaking,
              and Indigenous dreamline tracing. This multicultural approach reflects the universal nature
              of thread connections while honoring diverse ways of understanding the Weave.

              A twelve-year-old Chinese-American girl who discovers her rare multi-spectrum Thread Sight.
              After a traumatic convergence event, she develops Tactile Communion—a unique ability to
              experience the Weave through touch and full-body sensation. Her connection to the Animus
              Argenti marks her as a bridge between human consciousness and the awakening thread dimension.
